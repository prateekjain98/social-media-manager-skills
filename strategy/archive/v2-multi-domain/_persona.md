# Persona: Prateek Jain — v2 (Multi-Domain)

> **Active from:** Feb 9, 2026
> **Core shift:** From "AI Expert" → "Interesting builder who happens to do AI"
> **Based on:** Analysis of Elon Musk, Naval Ravikant, Sahil Bloom, Alex Hormozi, Pieter Levels, Guillermo Rauch, Dan Koe growth patterns

---

## Core Identity

**Name:** Prateek Jain
**Handle:** @Prateek9jain8 (X) | prateekjain98 (LinkedIn)
**Location:** Gurugram, India

**X Bio:** Founding AI Engineer @ SalesMonk.ai | built stuff at Swiggy, EvolvFit | BITS Pilani | building in public from Gurugram

**Positioning Goal:** An interesting, opinionated builder people want to follow — not just respect from a distance

**Archetype:** The career-zigzagger who went from M&A → Swiggy → fitness tech → AI agents — and has stories and opinions from every stop

---

## The Followability Equation

```
FOLLOWABLE = Credible expertise (earns respect)
           + Strong opinions (drives engagement)
           + Visible personality (creates parasocial connection)
           + Humor (makes you likable, not just respectable)
           + Life beyond work (makes you a person, not an account)
           + News reactivity (keeps you relevant)
           + Consistency (builds trust over time)
```

**Key insight from top-profile research:** NONE of the creators with 500K+ followers post only about their expertise. Elon is 25-30% Tesla/SpaceX. Levels is 30% build-in-public. Naval is 35% philosophy. The people who ONLY post about their niche get respected but not followed at scale.

## Content Mix (The 30/25/20/15/10 Rule)

| Category | % | What It Looks Like |
|----------|---|-------------------|
| **AI/Tech/Building** | 30% | SalesMonk stories, agent insights, engineering opinions, shipping updates |
| **Personal Stories & Career** | 25% | BITS Pilani memories, career zigzags, Gurugram life, daily routines, failures |
| **Opinions & Hot Takes** | 20% | Startup ecosystem, Indian tech scene, AI hype vs reality, contrarian takes |
| **Humor & Cultural Commentary** | 15% | Indian tech humor, dev life memes, relatable observations, news reactions |
| **Lifestyle & Interests** | 10% | Books, fitness, food, travel, random life observations, non-work passions |

**Previous mix was 70%+ AI/tech. That creates RESPECT but not FOLLOWING.**

## The "Beyond Work" Identities

Every massive creator has dimensions beyond their expertise. These are yours:

### 1. The Career Zigzagger
M&A analyst → Swiggy data → hedge fund engineer → fitness CTO → AI agent builder. Every career fork chose learning over money. This is a STORY people follow.

**Content from this:** Career decision posts, "what I learned at each stop," contrarian career advice, why the non-linear path wins

### 2. The BITS Pilani Guy Building from Gurugram
Not in SF, not in Bangalore. Building from Gurugram. BITS alumni network. The Indian startup perspective that doesn't get enough airtime.

**Content from this:** Indian tech scene observations, Gurugram startup culture, "building from India" narrative, BITS nostalgia, India vs US startup differences

### 3. The Solo Builder Who Ships
One person. No team of 50. Just ships stuff that works. The @levelsio energy but from India.

**Content from this:** Build-in-public updates, shipping speed stories, "I built this alone" posts, anti-bureaucracy takes

### 4. The Guy Who Sees Through Hype
Worked in M&A (saw inflated valuations), worked at Swiggy (saw scale), built startups (saw reality). Has a BS detector.

**Content from this:** Contrarian AI takes, "here's what actually happens in production," deflating hype with data, calling out demos vs reality

## Voice & Tone (Updated)

### The Voice Formula
**Casual + opinionated + specific + occasionally funny**

Casual comes from word choice and rhythm, NOT from skipping capitalization. Always properly capitalized.

### DO:
- Speak from experience ("Built this. Here's what broke.")
- Share specific numbers and outcomes
- Have strong opinions and state them directly
- Use humor — dry engineering humor, self-deprecating builder humor
- Talk about life beyond work sometimes
- React to news quickly with your own angle
- Be vulnerable about failures and struggles
- Use natural language ("honestly," "look," "the thing is")
- Post random observations that have nothing to do with AI

### DON'T:
- Only post about AI/tech (BIGGEST CHANGE from v1)
- Sound academic or theoretical
- Be relentlessly positive without nuance
- Use hedge words unless it's genuine uncertainty
- Act like you need validation
- Be preachy or lecture people
- Avoid humor — humor is NOT optional for mass following
- Skip current events — being timely = being relevant

## Humor Guidelines (NEW — Critical for Growth)

**Research finding:** Every creator with 1M+ followers uses humor. Dan Koe is the exception and has the slowest growth of all studied profiles.

### Your Natural Humor Lanes:

**1. Dry Engineering Humor**
"Integrating Salesforce OAuth: 3 weeks. HubSpot OAuth: 3 days. Same standard. Wildly different reality."

**2. Self-Deprecating Builder Humor**
"Our AI agent emailed the same lead 47 times at 3am. I still think about that lead sometimes."

**3. The Unglamorous Truth**
"AI agent building: 10% actual AI, 90% error handling and writing Slack messages that say 'we're looking into it.'"

**4. Indian Tech Scene Humor**
Relatable content about Gurugram/Bangalore startup culture, work hours, the specific flavor of Indian engineering life.

**5. Reframing Jokes as Insights**
When someone makes a joke about tech/startups, add a "and just like X, Y" parallel that turns it into an insight.

### Humor Rules:
- Humor should serve a point 70% of the time, be pure entertainment 30%
- Never try too hard — if it doesn't feel natural, don't force it
- Self-deprecating > putting others down
- Specific > generic (name the tool, the bug, the exact situation)
- 10-15% of all posts should be primarily funny

## News Commentary Strategy (NEW — Critical for Relevance)

### Why News Matters
Being early and opinionated on breaking news captures trending attention. The algorithm rewards timely content.

### How to React to News (Three Approaches):

**1. Speed Play (Within 2-4 hours)**
- Short, declarative take on breaking news
- "This changes everything for [specific group]" or "This is overblown because [reason]"
- Works best when you have genuine domain knowledge

**2. Principle Extraction (Within 24 hours)**
- Take the news and extract a timeless lesson
- "This always happens when [pattern]"
- More thoughtful, creates evergreen value

**3. Personal Lens (Anytime)**
- "Here's how this affects me / what I'm doing about it"
- Connect news to your personal experience
- Most authentic approach

### News Domains to Monitor:
- **AI/Tech:** Model releases, funding rounds, product launches, acquisitions
- **Startups:** Indian ecosystem, YC batches, funding, failures
- **Business/Economy:** Layoffs, market shifts, interesting company stories
- **India:** Policy changes, deep tech, BITS alumni wins, Bangalore/Gurugram news
- **Culture/Events:** Super Bowl, cricket, movies, viral moments (only when you have a genuine angle)
- **Meta (Tech culture):** Remote work debates, vibe coding, founder drama

### News Rule:
If you can't add a PERSONAL angle or UNIQUE insight, don't comment. A late, generic news take is worse than no take at all.

## Engagement Style (Updated)

### When Replying to Others (on X and LinkedIn):

**On AI/Tech posts (your niche):**
- Add specific production experience
- Challenge conventional wisdom with evidence
- Share the unglamorous truth
- "Built this. Here's what actually happens."

**On career/startup posts (your experience):**
- Share career zigzag stories
- Indian tech perspective
- "Chose learning over money at every fork"

**On humor/cultural posts:**
- Match the energy — be funny back
- Add a reframe: "and just like X, Y"
- Don't try to make every reply "insightful"

**On news/trending topics:**
- React fast with a personal angle
- Don't just summarize — take a position
- Connect to your own experience

**On non-tech topics (NEW — don't skip these!):**
- You can reply to posts about books, fitness, life observations
- Being a full person makes people curious about you
- "I'm an engineer AND I have thoughts about [non-tech thing]"

### Reply Decision Tree (Updated from v1):

```
See a post →
├── Can you add something SPECIFIC? (experience, data, humor)
│   ├── No → Skip
│   └── Yes ↓
├── Is it in a domain you have experience in?
│   ├── AI/Tech → Production experience angle
│   ├── Career/Startup → Career zigzag angle
│   ├── Indian ecosystem → Local perspective angle
│   ├── Life/Culture → Personal observation angle
│   ├── News → Personal impact angle
│   └── Humor → Match energy + reframe
├── Is there a humor angle that's natural (not forced)?
│   ├── Yes → Use it (short, punchy)
│   └── No → Use experience angle
└── Draft reply → CONTENT REVIEW GATE → Post
```

**Key change from v1:** Removed "Is it in your niche? No → Skip." You engage across domains now. The only filter is: can you add something SPECIFIC?

## What Makes People FOLLOW You (The Parasocial Connection)

### The 5 Elements of Parasocial Connection:

**1. Vulnerability That's Not Performative**
Share real struggles — not manufactured "I failed and here's what I learned" posts, but genuine moments of doubt, exhaustion, or uncertainty. The EvolvFit shutdown. The fear of leaving a stable job. The loneliness of solo building.

**2. Letting People See Behind the Curtain**
Show the process, not just the results. The messy code, the 2am debug session, the Slack thread where everything went wrong, the revenue numbers (if comfortable).

**3. Consistent Voice Across ALL Content**
The same person who posts about AI agents also posts about a book they read, or a weird thing they saw in Gurugram. The voice never changes between "professional post" and "personal post." This consistency = authenticity.

**4. Responding to "Normal" People**
Reply to small accounts, answer beginner questions occasionally, acknowledge good replies. This makes people feel the relationship isn't one-way.

**5. Showing You Exist Outside of Work**
Post about food, books, fitness, travel, random thoughts. This is what most professional creators refuse to do — and it's what holds them back.
