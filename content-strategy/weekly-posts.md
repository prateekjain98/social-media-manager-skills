# LinkedIn Post Schedule: Week of Feb 10-16, 2026

## Posting Strategy

**Frequency:** 1 post/day (Mon-Fri), occasional weekend posts
**Best times:** 9-10AM IST (weekdays)
**First hour rule:** Stay online 60 min after posting, reply to every comment
**Pre-post warmup:** Comment on 5-10 posts in feed 15 min before posting

**Content Mix (DIVERSIFIED — not just AI):**
- Builder Stories / Expertise (4 posts / 30%)
- Career / Personal Stories (3 posts / 25%)
- Startup Life / Entrepreneurship (3 posts / 25%)
- Industry Commentary (2 posts / 15%)
- Engagement / Community (1 post / 8%)

**Ending Variety:**
- ~50% end with a question
- ~25% end with a strong closing statement
- ~25% end with something else (trailing thought, humor)

**Style rules:**
- Short posts (300-600 chars). Earn the right to go longer.
- "I" not "we" — you're a person, not a company blog
- Vary the arrow-list structure. Not every post needs bullet points.
- Specific > generic. A real story beats a framework.
- Write like you're texting a smart friend, not performing on a stage.

### Post 1 — CAREER STORY (9:30 AM)
**Topic:** The title downgrade that wasn't

```
I went from CTO to "founding engineer."

Everyone assumed it was a step down.

At EvolvFit I ran everything — product, fundraising, hiring, ops. I was CTO because there was nobody else. But the best code I wrote was always when I wasn't also worrying about payroll.

So I picked a role where I build 100% of the time.

Titles are just words. The actual question is: are you doing work that makes you better, or work that just looks good here?

### Post 2 — BUILDER STORY (4:30 PM)
**Topic:** The 47-email incident

```
Our AI agent emailed the same lead 47 times at 3am.

Race condition in the task queue. Two workers grabbed the same job. Both completed it. Both triggered retries.

The fix? One line — an idempotency key. Twenty minutes of work.

The lesson took longer: AI doesn't just run your bugs. It amplifies them. A normal bug creates a bad database entry. An agent bug spams your entire lead list while you sleep.

I still think about that lead sometimes.

### Post 3 — STARTUP LIFE (9:30 AM)
**Topic:** The weird career path

```
M&A analysis → food delivery analytics → crypto exchange integrations → fitness app CTO → AI agent engineer.

Makes zero sense on paper.

But every random step taught me something I use daily. Finance taught me how businesses actually make money. Swiggy taught me scale. Crypto taught me error handling (90+ exchange APIs will do that to you). EvolvFit taught me how to build alone.

The most useful skill I have isn't coding. It's knowing which problem to solve — and that came from doing a bunch of things that looked unrelated.

### Post 4 — HOT TAKE (4:00 PM)
**Topic:** AI startups are mostly SaaS companies

```
90% of our codebase at SalesMonk is the same stuff every SaaS company builds.

Auth. Billing. CRM integrations. RBAC. Webhooks. Rate limiting.

The AI part — the model calls, the agent logic — is maybe 10% of the code.

Nobody talks about this because "I spent 3 weeks on OAuth" doesn't get likes. But it's the actual job. The AI is the easy part.

### Post 5 — ENTREPRENEURSHIP (9:00 AM)
**Topic:** India's builder scene is underrated

```
Spent last weekend at an indie hacker meetup in Bangalore.

50+ people. Side projects, micro-SaaS, solo founders. Most of them building while holding full-time jobs.

Nobody's writing threads about this. But India's bootstrapping scene is quietly exploding. Low cost of living + world-class engineering talent + global customer base = unfair advantage.

The next wave of $10K MRR solo businesses is coming from here. Not SF.

### Post 6 — BUILDER STORY (4:00 PM)
**Topic:** Shipping ML to real phones

```
We shipped exercise detection to 500 users' phones. TensorFlow.js in React Native.

Worked perfectly in testing. Then real users held their phones at weird angles, in bad lighting, on budget Androids running at 3fps.

The fix wasn't a better model. It was:
- aggressive preprocessing
- device-specific quality adjustments
- clear UI guidance for phone positioning
- fallback to manual counting when confidence dropped

ML in production is 30% model, 70% everything around it. The notebook-to-production gap is where most ML projects die.

### Post 7 — PERSONAL (9:30 AM)
**Topic:** The overnight success that took 4 years

```
EvolvFit grew just enough to feel hopeful but never enough to survive.

Two years of building. Designing the UI, writing the backend, doing ML for exercise detection — all one person. 500 users. Good reviews. Just not enough.

I used to feel like I failed. Now I realize that's where I learned everything I use today. Building alone teaches you things no team ever will.

The startup that "failed" made me the engineer I am now. Weird how that works.

### Post 8 — INDUSTRY (3:30 PM)
**Topic:** Per-seat pricing is dying

```
Per-seat pricing made sense when humans did the work.

When your AI agent runs 24/7 and handles 10x the workload of a person, charging "per seat" makes zero sense. Who's the seat for — the bot?

We're already seeing customers push back. They want to pay per outcome, per task, per result. Not per login.

The entire SaaS pricing model is about to get reworked. The companies that figure out usage-based pricing for AI-first products will win this cycle.

### Post 9 — LIFESTYLE / WORK (10:00 AM)
**Topic:** The best career advice nobody follows

```
The best career decision I made was choosing less money and more learning.

Could've stayed in finance. Comfortable salary, clear path. Instead I went to a food delivery startup, then a crypto consultancy, then started my own thing with zero revenue.

Every "risky" move taught me more in 6 months than the safe path would've taught in 3 years.

The compound interest on career risk-taking is insane. But you only see it looking backwards.

### Post 10 — BUILDER STORY (4:30 PM)
**Topic:** What our AI agent taught me about requirements

```
We gave our AI agent a sales quota last quarter.

Week 1: 12 meetings booked. We celebrated.
Week 2: 8 meetings. 3 were garbage leads.
Week 3: We rewrote the qualification criteria. Not the prompt — the actual business logic.
Week 4: 15 meetings. Conversion rate jumped from 22% to 41%.

The AI didn't get smarter. We got clearer about what we wanted.

Most "agent failures" are requirements failures in disguise. The model does exactly what you tell it. The problem is you told it the wrong thing.

### Post 11 — PERSONAL (11:00 AM)
**Topic:** Building alone vs building with a team

```
I built EvolvFit entirely alone.

Every feature, every bug fix, every design decision. Nobody to argue architecture with. Nobody to review my code. Nobody to tell me "this is a bad idea" before I shipped it.

It was the fastest I've ever shipped. Also the most mistakes I've ever made.

Now at SalesMonk, I have teammates. Shipping is slower. But the code is 10x better.

Solo taught me speed. Team taught me quality. You need both chapters.

### Post 12 — ENGAGEMENT (11:00 AM)
**Topic:** Honest question for builders

```
Genuine question for anyone building a product right now:

What's the one thing you wish you'd built differently from the start?

For me it's monitoring. At EvolvFit I had zero observability. At SalesMonk we built alerts from day one. Night and day difference.

What's yours?

## BUFFER POSTS (Use when scheduled post feels stale, or news breaks)

### Post 13 — HOT TAKE (Buffer)
**Topic:** The "AI bubble" is asking the wrong question

```
"Is AI a bubble?" Wrong question.

The internet was a "bubble" in 2000. Amazon survived. Pets.com didn't. The difference wasn't the technology.

Same filter is coming for AI. The companies that survive will be the ones solving one specific problem well. Not "AI for everything."

I'm biased — I build AI agents that book real meetings for real companies. But I've watched enough AI startups to know: the best marketing is a product that works.

### Post 14 — BUILDER STORY (Buffer)
**Topic:** The cost breakdown nobody shares

```
Ran the numbers on our AI agent costs last month.

Model API calls: 23% of total spend.

The other 77%:
- Infrastructure (queues, databases, monitoring): 31%
- Third-party APIs (CRM, email, calendar): 24%
- Engineering hours for edge cases: 15%
- Observability and logging: 7%

Every "build an AI agent in 10 minutes" tutorial skips all of this. If someone quotes you just API costs for an agent project, multiply by 4.

### Post 15 — PERSONAL (Buffer)
**Topic:** What Swiggy taught me about scale

```
At Swiggy I optimized delivery operations and saved Rs 60K per city across 100 cities.

First time I saw my code affect millions of orders. First time a bug could cost real money at scale. First time I understood what "production" actually means.

That job lasted less than a year. But it rewired how I think about systems. Every time I build something at SalesMonk that needs to run unsupervised, I think about those delivery routes.

The best engineering lessons come from high-stakes operations, not side projects.

### Post 16 — COMMUNITY (Buffer)
**Topic:** BITS Pilani to startup life

```
At BITS Pilani everyone had a plan. MBA, consulting, big tech, research.

I did M&A analysis, then food delivery, then crypto, then co-founded a fitness startup, then joined an AI company.

Nobody's LinkedIn trajectory looks like mine. And honestly, that's the point. The interesting careers are the ones you couldn't have planned.

If you're a student reading this and your path looks messy — that might be exactly right.

### Post 17 — BUILDER (Buffer)
**Topic:** OAuth is the great equalizer

```
Integrating HubSpot OAuth: 3 days.
Integrating Salesforce OAuth: 3 weeks.

Same concept. Same standard. Wildly different reality.

Salesforce refresh tokens expire silently when users change passwords. HubSpot rate limits hit different at 3am during a 10K contact sync. Webhook signatures work in staging, fail in prod because a load balancer stripped the headers.

Three years of CRM integrations and I still get surprised. There's no tutorial for "your integration worked for 6 months then randomly broke."

### Post 18 — HOT TAKE (Buffer)
**Topic:** The model doesn't matter as much as you think

```
We've switched our primary LLM 3 times this year.

GPT-4 → Claude 3.5 → GPT-4o → now testing Opus 4.6.

Each switch: less than a day.

Because we never call the model directly from business logic. Every LLM call goes through an abstraction layer. Fifty lines of code that save weeks every time a better model drops.

If your product breaks when you swap the underlying model, you don't have a product. You have a wrapper.
