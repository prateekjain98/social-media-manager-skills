# New Persona Setup

Create your own persona by copying this template folder.

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Copy the template
cp -r personas/_template personas/yourname

# 2. Fill in your details
# Edit each file in personas/yourname/strategy/

# 3. Start engaging
# The growth agent will use your persona files automatically
```

## Files to Fill Out

| File | Purpose | Priority |
|------|---------|----------|
| `strategy/_persona.md` | Your identity, background, voice, content pillars | **Do first** |
| `strategy/_growth-algorithm.md` | Daily execution algorithm, timing, targets | **Do second** |
| `strategy/_news-and-tools.md` | News sources, tools, analytics for your niche | Do third |
| `metrics.md` | Track your engagement (starts empty) | Fills over time |
| `content/` | Your posts, analyses, content samples | Fills over time |

## Shared Resources (Don't Copy)

These live at the repo root and work for all personas:

- `strategy/_core-principles.md` — Anti-AI detection rules (read this first)
- `skills/` — All 30 reusable skills (caption, hooks, threads, platform guides, etc.)
- `skills/automation/agent-browser.md` — Browser automation setup
- `.credentials.example.md` — Credentials template

## Tips

- Read `strategy/_core-principles.md` before writing anything
- Be specific in your persona — vague positioning = invisible content
- Fill in real stories and anecdotes — they're your biggest differentiator
- Start with Phase 1 (Reply Guy) unless you already have 500+ followers
- Your timezone matters — update the money window in the growth algorithm
