## The Trend Decision Framework

```
NEW TREND/NEWS APPEARS
├── Is this relevant to my content pillars?
│   ├── NO → Skip
│   └── YES → Do I have a unique take?
│       ├── NO → Skip (don't add noise)
│       └── YES → How fresh is it?
│           ├── < 1 hour → Post NOW (first-mover advantage)
│           ├── 1-6 hours → Only if your angle is genuinely different
│           └── > 6 hours → Skip unless you have deep analysis
