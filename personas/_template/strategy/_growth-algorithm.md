## X Algorithm Intelligence

### How the Algorithm Ranks Content

**Engagement Score:** `(RTs x 8) + (Bookmarks x 4) + (ProfileClicks x 3) + (Replies x 2) + (Likes x 0.5)`

**Distribution Funnel:**
1. **Seed:** Shown to 5-15% of your followers
2. **Expansion:** If engagement velocity is high, shown to followers-of-engagers
3. **Viral breakout:** If expansion performs, enters "For You" feed broadly
4. **Long tail:** Content continues distributing for up to 72 hours

**Key Signals:**
- Bookmarks = strongest hidden quality signal
- First 30-60 minutes = 80%+ of total reach
- Images get 2-3x boost (must be novel, not stock)
- Links suppressed ~50% — put links in replies instead
- Premium gives 2-4x reply visibility
- Reply engineering: 8-20 words optimal, first 10 replies get 10-100x visibility

### Shadowban Avoidance
- No mass follow/unfollow (>50/day)
- No identical or near-identical replies
- No rapid-fire actions (pace interactions naturally)
- Avoid Community Notes on your posts
- Don't delete and repost frequently

## Target Account Strategy

<!-- Fill these with accounts in YOUR niche -->

### TIER 1 — Reply Within Minutes (High-Visibility Accounts)
<!-- 5-10 accounts with 100K+ followers in your space -->
<!-- Format: @handle — [what they post about] -->

### TIER 2 — Daily Check (Broader Engagement)
<!-- 10-15 accounts with 10K-100K followers -->

### TIER 3 — Opportunistic (Ride Viral Moments)
<!-- Categories/topics to watch for trending posts -->

## Daily Algorithm (3 Sessions)

### CRITICAL: Your Money Window
<!-- Replace with YOUR timezone equivalent of US morning (8-10 AM ET) -->
<!-- This is when the most Twitter users are active -->

**Your timezone:** [TIMEZONE]
**Money window:** [TIME RANGE] (= US morning peak)

### Session 1: Morning ([TIME], [DURATION]) — Catchup
1. Check notifications, reply to replies on your content
2. Scan Tier 1 accounts for fresh posts (<2 hours old)
3. Leave 3-5 high-quality replies
4. Like/bookmark content from people you're building relationships with

### Session 2: Money Window ([TIME], [DURATION]) — HIGHEST PRIORITY
1. Search for high-engagement, low-reply posts: `min_faves:5000 max_replies:100`
2. Reply to 5-8 posts across Tier 1 and Tier 2 accounts
3. Post 1 original if you have something worth saying
4. Quote tweet something interesting with your take
5. Engage with any replies on your morning content

### Session 3: Late Session ([TIME], [DURATION]) — Ride Momentum
1. Follow up on anything that's getting traction
2. Reply to 2-3 more posts while US is still active
3. Engage with any new followers (check their content, like/reply)

## Reply Decision Tree

```
SEE POST
├── Do I have genuine value to add? (not just agreement)
│   ├── YES → What type of value?
│   │   ├── Humor (escalation joke, observational) → Keep it short (8-20 words)
│   │   ├── Contrarian reframe → "Everyone celebrates X but nobody mentions Y"
│   │   ├── Specific anecdote → Vivid, concrete personal story
│   │   ├── Data/fact most haven't seen → Cite the source
│   │   └── "Actually" correction → Only if you have proof
│   └── NO → Skip. Don't reply just to be seen.
├── Is this post < 2 hours old?
│   ├── YES → Reply NOW (first 10 replies get 10-100x visibility)
│   └── NO → Only reply if your take is exceptional
└── Like-to-reply ratio?
    ├── 5K+ likes, < 200 replies → HIGH PRIORITY (low competition)
    ├── 1K+ likes, < 100 replies → Good target
    └── Low likes or high replies → Skip unless Tier 1 account
```

## Content Review Gate

Before posting ANYTHING, run through this checklist:

### Step 1: VALUE CHECK
- Does this TEACH, INFORM, REFRAME, ENTERTAIN, or provide DATA?
- Would I engage with this if someone else posted it?
- If it's a reply: does it add to the conversation or just agree?

### Step 2: CRUTCH DETECTION
- Not starting with "Great point!" or "This is so true"
- Not generic praise ("Love this!", "Couldn't agree more")
- Personal experience is MAX 30% of replies (other 70%: concepts, data, reframes, humor)

### Step 3: PLATFORM FIT
- X: Under 280 chars (or use thread format for longer)
- LinkedIn: Professional but not corporate
- Reddit: Match the subreddit culture exactly

### Step 4: STANDARD CHECKS
- No AI buzzwords (leverage, unlock, dive in, game-changer)
- Sounds like a real person wrote it
- Specific > vague (numbers, names, details)

## Growth Benchmarks

| Phase | Followers | Timeline | Weekly growth |
|-------|-----------|----------|---------------|
| Phase 1 | 0 → 500 | Month 1-3 | 5-15/week |
| Phase 2 | 500 → 2K | Month 3-6 | 20-50/week |
| Phase 3 | 2K → 10K | Month 6-12 | 50-200/week |
| Phase 4 | 10K+ | Month 12+ | Accelerating |

First 1K is hardest. Growth is exponential, not linear.

- Likes: 30-50/day max
- Replies: 20-30/day max
- Original posts: 2-3/day max
- NEVER fabricate personal details — known facts only
