Built AI agents for 2 years. The model? Maybe 10% of the work.

The other 90% is retry logic, OAuth integrations, edge cases that only show up in production, and monitoring dashboards you never wanted to build.

The model is the easiest part to swap. Everything around it isn't.

## LinkedIn Post

Spent 2 years building AI sales agents.

Everyone asks what model we use. Almost nobody asks about the retry logic or the OAuth integrations.

Here's roughly where the time actually goes:

Error handling & retries — 25%
API integrations (CRMs, webhooks, OAuth) — 22%
Edge cases — 18%
Monitoring & debugging — 15%
Prompt engineering — 10%

The biggest misconception in AI right now is that the hard part is the model. It's not. It's everything around it — the integrations that silently fail, the edge cases that only show up in production, the observability that tells you something broke before your customers do.

The model is the easiest part to swap. The infrastructure around it isn't.

Companies winning with AI agents aren't winning on prompts. They're winning on the boring stuff — retries, integrations, observability.
