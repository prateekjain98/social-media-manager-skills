28,000 American Airlines flight attendants just voted no confidence in their CEO.

Every complaint they listed:

- Scheduling chaos during storms
- Crew sleeping on airport floors
- Dead last in customer satisfaction

These aren't leadership problems. They're automation problems.

AI agents can do real-time crew scheduling, predictive disruption management, and automated rebooking today.

The airline industry is running on infrastructure from the 90s. That's the real crisis.

28,000 American Airlines flight attendants just voted no confidence in their CEO.

First time in the union's history. And the numbers are brutal:

- Q4 profit: $111M. Delta made $1.2B. United made $1B.
- Dead last in J.D. Power customer satisfaction
- WSJ ranked them last overall among US airlines
- During a winter storm, crew slept on airport floors

The CEO's response to crew sleeping on floors? "Part of the job."

Everyone's framing this as a leadership crisis. But look at the actual complaints:

1. Scheduling chaos during weather disruptions
2. No real-time crew reallocation
3. Slow customer rebooking during cancellations
4. Reactive operations instead of predictive

Every single one is a solvable operations problem.

AI agents today can handle real-time crew scheduling during disruptions. Predictive weather rerouting before storms hit. Automated customer rebooking in minutes, not hours.

I build AI agents for a different domain. But the principle is the same — the boring operational stuff is exactly what AI is best at. Not flashy demos. Real-time decision-making at scale.

The airline industry is still running on systems designed in the 90s.

American Airlines doesn't just have a leadership problem. It has a 2026 problem being solved with 1996 tools.
