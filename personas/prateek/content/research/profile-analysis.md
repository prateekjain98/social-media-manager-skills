## 1. Current State Assessment

### What We Know From Internal Records

**Name:** Prateek Jain
**Location:** Gurugram, India
**LinkedIn followers:** ~8,517 (strong existing base)
**Education:** BITS Pilani, Bachelor of Engineering (GPA 8.14/10)

**Current Role (since Jan 2023):** Founding AI Engineer @ SalesMonk.ai
**Previous Roles:**
- Co-Founder & CTO @ EvolvFit (Oct 2021 - Dec 2022)
- Software Engineer @ NAV Consulting (Aug 2020 - Oct 2021)
- Business Analyst Intern @ Swiggy (Jul 2019 - Dec 2019)
- Investment Analyst Intern @ Grant Thornton India

**X Bio (current):** "Founding AI Engineer @ SalesMonk.ai | building agents that sell | 0->1 builder"

### Profile Completeness Score: Estimated 6/10

The profile likely has the basics filled in (headline, experience, education) but is almost certainly missing the depth needed to position Prateek as a recognized AI expert. The 8,517 followers are a strong foundation but were likely built organically through connections and normal LinkedIn activity -- not through deliberate AI thought-leadership positioning.

---

## 2. What Works

**Strong follower base for a non-creator profile.** 8,517 followers on LinkedIn without running a deliberate content strategy is genuinely impressive. It suggests a solid network (BITS Pilani alumni, Swiggy connections, startup community in Gurugram/NCR). This is a launchpad, not a starting point.

**Real credentials that matter.** Founding AI Engineer at a startup building AI sales agents is exactly the kind of role the AI-curious LinkedIn audience wants to hear from. This is not a "prompt engineer" title -- it is genuine technical leadership building production AI systems.

**BITS Pilani education.** In the Indian tech ecosystem, this carries weight. The alumni network is extensive and engaged on LinkedIn.

**Diverse experience path.** Grant Thornton (finance) -> Swiggy (operations/data) -> NAV Consulting (dev) -> EvolvFit (founder/CTO) -> SalesMonk (AI engineer) tells a compelling story of someone who has seen business from multiple angles before landing in AI. This is differentiated from the typical "I learned Python and now I do AI" crowd.

**Actual technical depth.** Full-stack (Next.js, NestJS, tRPC, Prisma, TypeScript) plus AI/ML (TensorFlow.js, LLM integrations, agent frameworks). This is not surface-level.

---

## 3. What Doesn't Work

### Likely Problems (Based on Profile Patterns of Similar Professionals)

**The headline is probably generic or role-focused.** "Founding AI Engineer @ SalesMonk.ai" alone does not tell people why they should follow Prateek or what value they will get. It describes a job, not an identity. LinkedIn headlines need to answer: "What will I learn from this person?"

**The About section is likely either missing, too short, or reads like a resume.** Most engineers treat the About section as a cover letter. For AI expert positioning, it needs to be a story -- what you are building, what you have learned, and why anyone should care.

**Experience descriptions probably list responsibilities, not outcomes.** "Built AI Sales Agents" is a responsibility. "Built AI agents that autonomously book 300+ meetings/month across 50+ B2B clients" is an outcome. The difference is what separates a profile someone reads from one they skim past.

**No Featured section (or underutilized).** This is the most wasted real estate on LinkedIn. Top AI experts use Featured to pin their best posts, articles, talks, or projects. If Prateek has not been posting AI content regularly, there is nothing to feature -- and that is the problem.

**No content history demonstrating expertise.** 8,517 followers with little posting activity means the profile is "dormant" from a thought-leadership perspective. LinkedIn's algorithm in 2026 heavily rewards niche authority built through consistent posting. A profile without posts is like a restaurant with no reviews -- people might walk by, but they will not come in.

**SalesMonk.ai is not a well-known brand.** This is not a weakness per se, but it means Prateek cannot rely on company brand recognition (unlike someone at Google AI or Anthropic). The positioning has to come from personal credibility and content, not from the logo.

---

## 4. Specific Gaps in AI Expert Positioning

### Gap 1: No Public Body of Work

The biggest gap. Prateek has real experience building AI agents in production, but none of it is documented publicly on LinkedIn. No posts about:
- Lessons learned building AI sales agents
- Technical architecture decisions
- Production failures and recoveries
- Agent reliability patterns
- The difference between demo AI and production AI

Without this, the "AI expert" claim has no supporting evidence on the platform where it matters most for his professional brand.

### Gap 2: No Clear "What I Teach" Signal

When someone lands on the profile, they should instantly know: "This person teaches me about building AI agents that actually work in production." Right now, they probably see: "This person works at a startup." Those are very different profile experiences.

### Gap 3: Missing the "Builder" Narrative

Prateek's strongest card is the 0-to-1 builder trajectory: EvolvFit (built entire tech stack from scratch, ML in production with TensorFlow.js, scaled to 500+ users) -> SalesMonk (building AI agents from scratch). This is a rare and compelling story. Most "AI experts" on LinkedIn have never shipped a real product. Prateek has shipped multiple. This story is probably not told anywhere on the profile.

### Gap 4: No Proof Through Numbers

The persona file contains excellent numbers that should be on the profile:
- 500+ users at EvolvFit
- 90+ crypto exchange integrations
- 200+ hedge fund management
- Rs 60,000/city cost savings across 100+ cities at Swiggy
- 10+ trainers on the EvolvFit platform

These numbers build instant credibility. If they are buried in bullet points (or absent), that is a missed opportunity.

### Gap 5: No Network Positioning

Prateek is not visibly connected to the AI conversation on LinkedIn. No comments on posts from AI leaders, no engagement with AI-focused content, no tags from peers. LinkedIn's algorithm connects people through engagement graphs -- if you are not in the conversation, you are not in the feed.

### Gap 6: Skills and Endorsements Not Optimized

LinkedIn's search algorithm weighs skills heavily. If the skills section lists generic items like "JavaScript" and "React" instead of "AI Agents," "LLM Integration," "AI Sales Automation," "Agent Orchestration," the profile will not surface for AI-related searches.

### Gap 7: No Recommendations That Reinforce AI Expertise

Recommendations from co-founders, clients, or colleagues that specifically mention AI capabilities, agent development, or technical leadership in AI would massively strengthen the profile. Generic "Prateek is a great team player" recommendations do nothing for expert positioning.

---

## 5. Headline Recommendations

### Current (Assumed): "Founding AI Engineer @ SalesMonk.ai"

This is fine as a job title but fails as a positioning statement. Here are specific alternatives ranked by effectiveness:

### Option A (Recommended - Builder Identity)
```
Founding AI Engineer @ SalesMonk.ai | Building AI agents that sell | 0->1 builder who ships
```
**Why:** Combines the credible title with a specific claim ("agents that sell") and a personality marker ("0->1 builder who ships"). This tells you what he builds and how he operates.

### Option B (Expertise + Value Signal)
```
Building AI Sales Agents in Production @ SalesMonk.ai | I write about what actually works (and what breaks)
```
**Why:** "In production" immediately separates Prateek from the thousands of people who build AI demos. "What actually works (and what breaks)" signals the kind of content people will get.

### Option C (Authority + Niche)
```
Founding AI Engineer | AI agents that book meetings, not just chat | Ex-CTO @ EvolvFit | BITS Pilani
```
**Why:** The "not just chat" framing is a strong differentiator. Including the ex-CTO credential and BITS adds authority layers. This works well for the Indian tech LinkedIn audience.

### Option D (Content-Forward)
```
I build AI agents that sell | Founding Engineer @ SalesMonk.ai | Writing about production AI, not AI hype
```
**Why:** Leads with what he does (not his title), includes the credibility marker, and explicitly sets content expectations. The "not AI hype" framing is a strong hook.

### What NOT to Do
- "Passionate about AI and building products" -- generic, means nothing
- "AI/ML | Full Stack | Startup | Innovation" -- keyword soup, no personality
- "Helping companies leverage AI" -- sounds like a consultant, not a builder
- Emojis as separators (rockets, lightbulbs) -- screams "I read a LinkedIn optimization article"

---

## 6. About Section Recommendations

### Current About Section: Likely Missing or Resume-Style

The About section needs to do three things: (1) tell a story, (2) establish credibility, and (3) give people a reason to follow.

### Recommended About Section (Draft)

```
I build AI agents that actually work in production. Not demos. Not POCs. Real systems that book real meetings for real companies.

Right now, I'm the Founding AI Engineer at SalesMonk.ai, where I built our AI sales agent stack from scratch -- the kind that autonomously prospects, qualifies leads, and books meetings without a human in the loop. The tech: Next.js, NestJS, TypeScript, with native integrations into HubSpot, Salesforce, and Slack.

Before this, I was CTO of EvolvFit, where I built an entire fitness tech platform from zero -- MERN stack, React Native mobile app, and an ML-powered exercise detection system using TensorFlow.js that actually worked in production (not just in a notebook). We scaled to 500+ users and 10+ trainers.

Before that: built crypto exchange integrations for 90+ funds at NAV Consulting, and did data analysis at Swiggy that saved Rs 60K per city across a 100-city expansion.

What I write about here:
- Building AI agents that go beyond chat (autonomous execution, not assistance)
- The unglamorous parts of shipping AI products (error recovery, state management, the 3am debugging sessions)
- Full-stack architecture decisions when you ARE the entire engineering team
- What it's actually like going 0-to-1 at a startup

I studied at BITS Pilani (Engineering, 8.14 GPA).

If you're building AI agents or thinking about it, let's connect. I share what works, what breaks, and what I wish someone had told me.
```

### Why This Works
- **Opens with a strong claim** that immediately differentiates (production, not demos)
- **Tells a story** through career progression, not a list of skills
- **Includes specific numbers** (500+ users, 90+ funds, 100+ cities, Rs 60K savings)
- **Sets content expectations** so people know what they will get by following
- **Ends with a CTA** that is natural, not salesy
- **Conversational tone** -- reads like a person talking, not a resume
- **Mentions specific tech** for searchability without being a keyword dump

### What to Absolutely Avoid
- Starting with "Results-driven professional with 5+ years of experience"
- Listing skills without context
- Using third person ("Prateek is a...")
- Generic closing like "Open to opportunities" (unless actually job hunting)
- Bullet-point-only format with no narrative

---

## 7. What's Missing From the Profile

### Critical Missing Elements

**1. Featured Section**
Must include:
- 2-3 best LinkedIn posts about AI agents (need to create these first)
- A link to SalesMonk.ai
- Any demo videos or product screenshots of the AI agent in action
- A carousel/document post about "How we built our AI agent stack"

**2. Creator Mode / Content Strategy**
LinkedIn creator mode (if not already enabled) provides:
- "Follow" button instead of "Connect" (better for thought leadership)
- Ability to set up to 5 topic hashtags on profile
- Priority in LinkedIn's content distribution

Recommended topic hashtags: #AIAgents #ProductionAI #StartupEngineering #SalesAutomation #BuildInPublic

**3. Activity/Posts**
The profile needs a consistent posting cadence. Recommended immediate content:
- Post 1: "What I learned building AI sales agents from scratch (thread)"
- Post 2: "The difference between AI demos and AI in production"
- Post 3: "Why error recovery is the hardest part of building AI agents"
- Post 4: "From CTO of a fitness startup to AI engineer -- why I made the switch"
- Post 5: A carousel on "5 things your AI agent needs before it goes to production"

**4. Skills Section Overhaul**
Top skills should be reordered to prioritize:
1. AI Agents / AI Engineering
2. Large Language Models (LLMs)
3. TypeScript / Full-Stack Development
4. Startup Engineering / 0-to-1 Product Development
5. Sales Automation / AI Sales

Remove or deprioritize generic skills like "HTML" or "CSS" that dilute the AI positioning.

**5. Recommendations**
Specifically request recommendations from:
- SalesMonk.ai co-founder/CEO mentioning AI agent capabilities
- EvolvFit co-founder mentioning technical leadership and ML work
- NAV Consulting colleagues mentioning the crypto integration scope
- BITS Pilani peers who can speak to technical ability

Each recommendation should mention specific AI/technical achievements, not generic praise.

**6. Certifications / Projects Section**
If any AI/ML courses, certifications, or notable open-source contributions exist, they should be added. If not, consider:
- Publishing a technical article on building AI agents (can be on LinkedIn itself)
- Contributing to an open-source agent framework
- Speaking at a local AI meetup (even a small one)

**7. Custom Profile URL**
Ensure the URL is linkedin.com/in/prateekjain98 (appears to be set -- good).

**8. Profile Photo and Banner**
- Profile photo should be professional but approachable (not a formal headshot, think "confident engineer")
- Banner image should reinforce AI positioning -- could include: SalesMonk branding, a tagline like "Building AI Agents That Sell," or an abstract AI/tech visual

---

## 8. Comparison to Top AI Experts on LinkedIn

### How They Present Themselves

**Pattern 1: The Builder (e.g., Harrison Chase - LangChain)**
- Headline leads with what they build, not their title
- About section tells the origin story of their product
- Content is 90% educational, 10% promotional
- Featured section showcases the product and key posts

**Pattern 2: The Practitioner (e.g., Chip Huyen, Shreya Shankar)**
- Headline combines role + specific expertise area
- About section explains their unique angle on AI
- Posts are a mix of technical deep-dives and industry commentary
- Regular cadence (3-5 posts/week)

**Pattern 3: The Founder-Engineer (e.g., Pieter Levels, McKay Wrigley)**
- Headline is punchy and personality-forward
- About section reads like a conversation
- Build-in-public content with real numbers
- Strong opinions, not afraid to be wrong publicly

### Where Prateek Fits (and Doesn't)

Prateek's natural positioning is closest to **Pattern 3: The Founder-Engineer** -- someone who has built multiple products from scratch, has technical depth, and has the founder experience to share real business insights alongside technical ones.

**What the top AI experts do that Prateek currently does NOT:**

| Element | Top AI Experts | Prateek (Current) |
|---------|---------------|-------------------|
| Regular posting | 3-5x/week minimum | Likely sporadic or none |
| Specific niche claim | "The LLM orchestration person" | No clear AI niche claimed |
| Build-in-public content | Share wins, failures, numbers | No public sharing of building journey |
| Engage on other leaders' posts | Daily, thoughtful comments | Likely minimal |
| Featured section curated | Best content prominently displayed | Probably empty or default |
| Headline = positioning | "I build X that does Y" | Probably just job title |
| About = story | Narrative with personality | Probably resume-style |
| Recommendations = social proof | Specific, achievement-focused | Likely generic or few |

### The Core Difference

Top AI experts on LinkedIn are not more qualified than Prateek. Many have less production experience. The difference is **they talk about their work publicly and consistently.** Prateek has the credentials, the experience, and the stories. What is missing is the public layer -- the content, the engagement, the visible presence in AI conversations.

The gap is not in expertise. It is in visibility.

## 10. The Bottom Line

Prateek Jain has the raw material to be a credible, visible AI expert on LinkedIn. The background is strong (BITS Pilani, Swiggy, EvolvFit CTO, SalesMonk founding engineer). The current work is in one of the hottest spaces in tech (AI agents for sales automation). The 8,517 followers give a distribution advantage most people starting out do not have.

The problem is not credentials. It is presentation and activity. The profile likely reads as a resume, not as a thought leadership platform. There is no visible content strategy, no public documentation of the AI work being done, and no engagement with the broader AI conversation on LinkedIn.

The fix is straightforward but requires consistency:
1. Optimize the profile (headline, about, skills, featured) -- one-time effort, 2-3 hours
2. Start posting regularly about AI agent development -- ongoing, 30 min/day
3. Engage on other people's AI content -- ongoing, 15 min/day
4. Build social proof through recommendations and features -- gradual, over 2-4 weeks

The 8,517 followers are an asset most people would kill for. The question is whether Prateek activates that audience with content worth following for, or lets it sit dormant while others with less experience but more visibility claim the "AI expert" positioning.
