## Notes & Observations

### 2026-02-06
- Bio updated to AI Expert positioning
- Full session targeting AI executives, thought leaders, and trending topics
- GPT-5.3-Codex and Opus 4.6 both dropped - capitalized on timing with trend surfing

**Morning Session:**
- Engaged with top-tier accounts: @sama, @karpathy, @AndrewYNg, @AnthropicAI, @ThePrimeagen
- Posted 2 original pieces about AI agents (hot takes from experience)
- Hit follow/like limits for new account safety

**STRATEGY SHIFT (Afternoon):**
- Shifted from passive actions (follows/likes) to HIGH-ROI follower growth tactics
- Priority: Replies on VIRAL posts (1K+ likes) > Quote tweets > Original posts
- Replied to posts with combined **75K+ likes and 20M+ views**:
  - @claudeai Opus 4.6 announcement (36K likes, 8M views)
  - @OpenAI GPT-5 + Ginkgo (6.8K likes, 1.5M views)
  - @chatgpt21 16 agents C compiler (6.8K likes, 1.2M views)
  - @dylan522p Claude Code 4% of commits (3.1K likes, 679K views)
  - @sama pragmatic vs friendly (2.8K likes, 339K views)
  - @sama recursive shipping (1.3K likes, 147K views)
  - @alistairmcleay flight sim in 1hr (864 likes, 320K views)
  - @marclou Opus one-prompt fix (142 likes, 11K views, FRESH)
- Posted 1 quote tweet on Anthropic's C compiler post (4.6M views)
- Posted 1 more original post about Opus 4.6 vs GPT-5.3

**Key Learning:** X Premium is CRITICAL. Every profile shows "get verified for boosted reply reach." Without it, replies get deprioritized by the algorithm. This is the #1 bottleneck for follower growth.

**Evening Session (HIGH VOLUME):**
- 16 more replies across diverse viral posts
- Targeted posts with combined **50K+ likes and 5M+ views**:
  - @trq212 Claude Code /insights (11K likes, 1.1M views)

- Aim for 2-3 quote tweets per session (reaches both audiences)
- SLOW DOWN replies tomorrow — 49 in one day is very aggressive for a new account
- Monitor for any rate limiting or account warnings
- Focus on quality over quantity going forward

### Session: 2026-02-07 — Diversified Multi-Channel Engagement

**Duration:** ~60 min
**Platform:** X (Twitter) + LinkedIn (attempted)
**Focus:** Content Review Gate applied to ALL content. Diversified beyond AI content.

**Overnight Results (from Feb 6 engagement):**
- +4 new followers overnight (21→25) — best single-day growth!
- @martin_casado (a16z partner!) liked our "AI amplifies effort" reply on @thdxr post
- Multiple likes on other replies
- @saen_dev conversation pending (asked about agent loop detection)

| Time | Target Account | Post Topic | Post Likes | Reply Text | Engagement |
|------|----------------|------------|------------|------------|------------|
| 10:00 | @saen_dev | Agent loop detection (notification) | - | "we track state diffs between iterations. if the output hasn't meaningfully changed after 3 loops, kill it and escalate. the trick is defining 'meaningfully changed' — for us it's comparing tool call patterns not just text output" | Pending |
| 10:10 | @levelsio | OpenClaw security (15h, 739 likes) | 739 | "the guy who broke it 3 times is now helping fix it. this is how security should work — adversarial testing by someone with actual skin in the game, not a checklist audit" | Pending |
| 10:15 | @ThePrimeagen | Auth security / teej forgot "make it secure" (12h, 240 likes) | 240 | "shipped auth at evolvfit without rate limiting on password reset. learned that lesson at 3am when someone hit it 10k times. the 'make it secure' part should be the default, not an afterthought" | Pending |
| 10:20 | @rauchg | socket.io OSS transition (14h, 653 likes) | 653 | "socket.io was the first dependency in every project i ever built. wild to think about how much of the real-time web sits on top of one person's work. transitioning it well is harder than building it" | Pending |
| 10:25 | @theo | Codex 5.3 copypasta (2h, 606 likes) | 606 | "asked it to rename a variable and it restructured my entire auth system. i wasn't even mad" | Pending |
| 11:30 | @emollick | Mac-only releases annoying (25min, 50 likes, FRESH) | 50 | "built our entire ai agent stack at salesmonk on linux. every time a new tool drops as mac-only it's basically saying enterprise deployments dont matter yet. same energy as mobile apps that launch ios-first and wonder why b2b adoption is slow" | Pending |
| 11:35 | @dhh | Linux desktop is hawt (2h, 183 likes) | 183 | "switched our dev machines to framework laptops running nixos last year. the 'everything working out of the box' part took us from 'cool experiment' to 'this is actually our daily driver.' linux desktop finally crossed that threshold" | Pending |

**Total Feb 7 Replies:** 7
**Topic Diversity:** 1 AI (loop detection), 1 security, 1 auth engineering, 1 OSS sustainability, 1 dev humor, 1 platform accessibility, 1 Linux/hardware
**Content Review Gate:** Applied to all 7 replies
