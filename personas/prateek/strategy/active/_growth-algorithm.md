## Cross-Platform Strategy (Prateek-specific)

```
LINKEDIN (8,500 followers) → X:
├── Screenshot best-performing LinkedIn post
├── Share on X as quote tweet with commentary
├── LinkedIn followers discover X account; X followers discover LinkedIn

CONTENT ADAPTATION EXAMPLE:
Original insight: "Our AI agent booked 3x meetings but conversion dropped 40%"

X reply: "AI agents book meetings. The conversion problem nobody talks about:
3x meetings, 40% lower close rate. The meetings were real, the intent wasn't."

LinkedIn post: "We automated outbound at SalesMonk. Our AI agent booked 3x more meetings.
But conversion dropped 40%.
The meetings were real. The intent wasn't. We had to add a qualification layer..."

Reddit comment: "ran into this exact problem. we automated outbound and meetings went 3x
but conversion tanked. turned out the AI was great at getting people to say yes to a meeting
but wasn't qualifying intent. YMMV but focus on qualification criteria first"
```
