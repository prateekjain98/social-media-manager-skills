# LinkedIn Post Schedule: Week of Feb 10-16, 2026

## Posting Strategy

**Frequency:** 1 post/day (Mon-Fri), occasional weekend posts
**Best times:** 9-10AM IST (weekdays)
**First hour rule:** Stay online 60 min after posting, reply to every comment
**Pre-post warmup:** Comment on 5-10 posts in feed 15 min before posting

**Content Mix (DIVERSIFIED — not just AI):**
- Builder Stories / Expertise (4 posts / 30%)
- Career / Personal Stories (3 posts / 25%)
- Startup Life / Entrepreneurship (3 posts / 25%)
- Industry Commentary (2 posts / 15%)
- Engagement / Community (1 post / 8%)

**Format Mix (MANDATORY — no 3 mini-essays in a row):**
- Mini-essay with story arc: max 4/week
- Short observation (under 200 chars): at least 2/week
- Data/numbers drop: at least 1/week
- Humor-first: at least 1/week
- Question/engagement: 1/week
- News reaction: 1/week (template slot — fill day-of)

**Ending Variety:**
- ~50% end with a question
- ~25% end with a strong closing statement
- ~25% end with something else (trailing thought, humor)

**Style rules:**
- Short posts (300-600 chars). Earn the right to go longer.
- "I" not "we" — you're a person, not a company blog
- Vary the structure. Not every post needs bullet points or a story arc.
- Specific > generic. A real story beats a framework.
- Write like you're texting a smart friend, not performing on a stage.
- Some posts should be 2-3 lines. Not everything needs a lesson.
- Humor is not optional. At least 1 post/week should be primarily funny.

### Post 1 — CAREER STORY (9:30 AM)
**Topic:** The title downgrade that wasn't
**Format:** Mini-essay

```
I went from CTO to "founding engineer."

Everyone assumed it was a step down.

At EvolvFit I ran everything — product, fundraising, hiring, ops. I was CTO because there was nobody else. But the best code I wrote was always when I wasn't also worrying about payroll.

So I picked a role where I build 100% of the time.

Titles are just words. The actual question is: are you doing work that makes you better, or work that just looks good on LinkedIn?

### Post 2 — BUILDER STORY (4:30 PM)
**Topic:** The 47-email incident
**Format:** Mini-essay (with humor)

```
Our AI agent emailed the same lead 47 times in one night.

Race condition in the task queue. Two workers grabbed the same job. Both completed it. Both triggered retries.

The fix? One line — an idempotency key. Twenty minutes of work.

AI doesn't just run your bugs. It amplifies them. A normal bug creates a bad database entry. An agent bug spams your entire lead list while you sleep.

I still think about that lead sometimes.

### Post 3 — SHORT OBSERVATION (9:30 AM)
**Topic:** What the job actually is
**Format:** Ultra-short (under 200 chars)

```
Shipped a feature last week. 200 lines of code.

180 of them are error handling.

This is the job.

### Post 4 — HOT TAKE (4:00 PM)
**Topic:** AI startups are mostly SaaS companies
**Format:** Mini-essay

```
90% of our codebase at SalesMonk is the same stuff every SaaS company builds.

Auth. Billing. CRM integrations. RBAC. Webhooks. Rate limiting.

The AI part — the model calls, the agent logic — is maybe 10% of the code.

Nobody talks about this because "I spent 3 weeks on OAuth" doesn't get likes. But it's the actual job. The AI is the easy part.

### Post 5 — HUMOR (9:00 AM)
**Topic:** The engineering reality gap
**Format:** Short / funny

```
Most satisfying part of my job: building the AI agent logic.

Actual majority of my job: figuring out why a webhook from HubSpot stopped firing on Tuesdays specifically.

**Ending:** Punchline (no lesson — just funny)

### Post 6 — BUILDER STORY (4:00 PM)
**Topic:** Shipping ML to real phones
**Format:** Mini-essay

```
We shipped exercise detection to 500 users' phones. TensorFlow.js in React Native.

Worked perfectly in testing. Then real users held their phones at weird angles, in bad lighting, on budget Androids running at 3fps.

The fix wasn't a better model. It was aggressive preprocessing, device-specific quality adjustments, clear UI guidance, and fallback to manual counting when confidence dropped.

ML in production is 30% model, 70% everything around it.

### Post 7 — PERSONAL (9:30 AM)
**Topic:** The useful failure
**Format:** Mini-essay (vulnerability)

```
EvolvFit grew just enough to feel hopeful but never enough to survive.

Two years of building. Designing the UI, writing the backend, doing ML for exercise detection — all one person. 500 users. Good reviews. Just not enough.

I used to feel like I failed. Now I realize that's where I learned everything I use today. Building alone teaches you things no team ever will.

The startup that "failed" made me the engineer I am now. Weird how that works.

### Post 8 — INDUSTRY (3:30 PM)
**Topic:** Per-seat pricing is dying
**Format:** Short take

```
Per-seat pricing made sense when humans did the work.

Our AI agent handles the workload of 3 SDRs. Runs 24/7. Doesn't take PTO. Charging "per seat" for that makes zero sense.

Customers already push back. They want to pay per meeting booked, per lead qualified, per result. Not per login.

### Post 9 — DATA DROP (10:00 AM)
**Topic:** The real cost of AI agents
**Format:** Data/numbers (Deedy Das style)

```
Our AI agent cost breakdown last month:

Model API calls: 23%

The other 77%:
- Infrastructure (queues, DBs, monitoring): 31%
- Third-party APIs (CRM, email, calendar): 24%
- Edge case engineering hours: 15%
- Observability and logging: 7%

If someone quotes you just API costs for an agent project, multiply by 4.

### Post 10 — NEWS REACTION (4:30 PM)
**Topic:** [FILL DAY-OF — React to whatever breaks this week]
**Format:** Short take (3-5 lines)

```
[TEMPLATE — Do not pre-write. Check AI/tech/startup news Friday morning.]

Rules for this slot:
1. Pick ONE story you have a genuine personal angle on
2. 3-5 lines max. Take a position, don't summarize.
3. Connect to your own experience at SalesMonk, EvolvFit, or career
4. If nothing compelling breaks, swap in Buffer Post 13 or 14

Example format:
"[News thing] happened. Here's what people are missing: [your angle]. I've seen this because [specific experience]."
```
**Type:** News / Commentary
**Ending:** Varies

### Post 11 — NON-WORK (11:00 AM)
**Topic:** The debugging walk
**Format:** Short / relatable

```
The best debugging sessions happen when I stop debugging.

Walk around the block, come back, solve the bug in 10 minutes.

I know this. I still stare at the screen for 3 hours first every single time.

### Post 12 — ENGAGEMENT (11:00 AM)
**Topic:** The hardest part of being a founding engineer
**Format:** Short essay + question

```
The hardest part of being a founding engineer isn't the code.

It's deciding what NOT to build.

Every feature request feels urgent. Every customer ask feels like the unlock. But the product only improves when you say no to 80% of it.

What's the hardest "no" you've had to give on a product decision?

## BUFFER POSTS (Use when scheduled post feels stale, or news breaks)

### Post 13 — BUILDER (Buffer)
**Topic:** OAuth is the great equalizer
**Format:** Comparison

```
Integrating HubSpot OAuth: 3 days.
Integrating Salesforce OAuth: 3 weeks.

Same concept. Same standard. Wildly different reality.

Salesforce refresh tokens expire silently when users change passwords. HubSpot rate limits hit differently during a 10K contact sync. Webhook signatures work in staging, fail in prod because a load balancer stripped the headers.

Three years of CRM integrations and I still get surprised.

### Post 14 — HOT TAKE (Buffer)
**Topic:** The model doesn't matter as much as you think
**Format:** Short essay

```
We've switched our primary LLM 3 times this year.

GPT-4 → Claude 3.5 → GPT-4o → now testing Opus 4.6.

Each switch: less than a day.

Because we never call the model directly from business logic. Every LLM call goes through an abstraction layer. Fifty lines of code that save weeks every time a better model drops.

If your product breaks when you swap the underlying model, you don't have a product. You have a wrapper.

### Post 15 — PERSONAL (Buffer)
**Topic:** What Swiggy taught me about scale
**Format:** Mini-essay

```
At Swiggy I optimized delivery operations and saved Rs 60K per city across 100 cities.

First time I saw my code affect millions of orders. First time a bug could cost real money at scale. First time I understood what "production" actually means.

That job lasted less than a year. But it rewired how I think about systems. Every time I build something at SalesMonk that needs to run unsupervised, I think about those delivery routes.

### Post 16 — BUILDER (Buffer)
**Topic:** What our AI agent taught me about requirements
**Format:** Week-by-week narrative

```
We gave our AI agent a sales quota last quarter.

Week 1: 12 meetings booked. We celebrated.
Week 2: 8 meetings. 3 were garbage leads.
Week 3: We rewrote the qualification criteria. Not the prompt — the actual business logic.
Week 4: 15 meetings. Conversion rate jumped from 22% to 41%.

The AI didn't get smarter. We got clearer about what we wanted.

Most "agent failures" are requirements failures in disguise.

### Post 17 — SHORT TAKE (Buffer)
**Topic:** The interviewing paradox
**Format:** Ultra-short

```
Funny thing about hiring engineers:

The best candidate I ever worked with couldn't solve a single LeetCode medium in the interview.

The worst one solved all three.

### Post 18 — HUMOR (Buffer)
**Topic:** The integration reality
**Format:** Short / funny

```
Things I thought I'd build as an AI engineer:
- Autonomous agents
- ML pipelines
- Intelligent reasoning systems

Things I actually build:
- OAuth refresh token retry logic
- Webhook deduplication
- Slack error notifications that say "we're looking into it"
