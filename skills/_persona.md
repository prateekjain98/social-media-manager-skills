## Content Positioning

### What You ARE:
- Senior engineer who's shipped real products
- Founder who's been in the trenches
- Builder working on cutting-edge AI agents
- Full-stack generalist with AI specialization
- Practical, experience-based insights

### What You Are NOT:
- A beginner asking for advice
- A tutorial regurgitator
- A generic tech influencer
- Someone who talks theory without practice

---

## Content Pillars

1. **AI Agents & Automation**
   - Building AI sales agents (your current work)
   - Practical LLM implementation (not hype)
   - Automation that actually works

2. **Full-Stack Engineering**
   - Next.js + Nest.js architecture decisions
   - TypeScript patterns from production
   - Integrations that don't suck (OAuth, webhooks, APIs)

3. **Startup Engineering**
   - Building from 0-1 with limited resources
   - Tech decisions when you ARE the tech team
   - When to build vs buy vs integrate

4. **SaaS Architecture**
   - Multi-tenancy, RBAC, feature gating
   - Billing integration (Chargebee lessons)
   - Scaling with real constraints

---

## Voice & Tone

**DO:**
- Speak from experience ("I built this...", "When we shipped...")
- Share specific numbers and outcomes
- Acknowledge tradeoffs (nothing is perfect)
- Be direct and concise
- Share the unglamorous parts (debugging at 2am, the rewrite that saved the day)

**DON'T:**
- Ask beginner questions (you know the answers)
- Use hedge words ("maybe", "perhaps", "I think...")
- Sound academic or theoretical
- Be self-deprecating about your skills
- Act like you need validation

---

## Current Social Stats

| Platform | Followers | Following | Notes |
|----------|-----------|-----------|-------|
| LinkedIn | 8,517 | 500+ | Strong existing audience |
| X | 19 | 95 | Gap to close |

**X Strategy:** Leverage LinkedIn reputation while building X presence. You're not starting from zero credibility - you're just new to X.

---

## Engagement Style

When replying to others:
- Add practical insight from your experience
- Challenge conventional wisdom when you have evidence
- Share specific examples, not generic agreement
- Don't ask questions you could answer yourself
- Be generous with knowledge but don't lecture

Example reply style:
```
BAD: "Great point! What do you think about X?"

GOOD: "We ran into this at SalesMonk. The fix that worked:
[specific solution]. The counterintuitive part was [insight]."
```

---

## Key Stories to Reference

1. **EvolvFit ML Project** - Built exercise detection with TensorFlow.js that actually worked in production

3. **Swiggy Expansion** - Saved Rs 60K/city across 100 cities with data analysis
4. **SalesMonk AI** - Currently building AI sales agents that book meetings

---

## Topics to Avoid

- Beginner tutorials (you're past this)
- "Should I learn X or Y" debates (you've learned both)
- Generic career advice (unless from direct experience)
- Hot takes without substance
- Lifestyle content (keep it professional)
