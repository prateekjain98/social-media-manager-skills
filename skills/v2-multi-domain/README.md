# v2 — Multi-Domain Personality Strategy

**Active from:** Feb 9, 2026
**Supersedes:** v1 files in parent `skills/` folder (marked as archived)

## What Changed and Why

### v1 Problem (Feb 6-9)
- Positioned as "AI Expert" — only 4 content pillars, ALL tech/AI
- "Topics to Avoid" included lifestyle content
- Reply decision tree said "Is it in your niche? No → Skip"
- Zero humor guidelines
- No news monitoring
- Result: Creates RESPECT but not FOLLOWING. Caps growth.

### v2 Strategy
- Positioned as "Interesting builder who happens to do AI"
- 8 content pillars spanning AI, career, humor, lifestyle, news, Indian tech
- Reply to ANY viral post where you can add something specific
- Humor is mandatory (10-15% of content)
- News reactivity built into daily workflow
- Content mix: 30% AI / 25% personal / 20% opinions / 15% humor / 10% lifestyle

### Research Basis
Analyzed 7 profiles with 500K-200M followers:
- Elon Musk, Naval Ravikant, Sahil Bloom, Alex Hormozi
- Pieter Levels, Guillermo Rauch, Dan Koe

Key finding: **NONE of them post only about their expertise.** Personality + humor + opinions + life = mass following.
