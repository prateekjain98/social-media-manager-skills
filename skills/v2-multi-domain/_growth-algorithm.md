## How Followers Actually Grow (unchanged — still true)

```
FOLLOWER GROWTH FUNNEL:
Your reply on viral post (1K+ likes)
→ Reply gets likes/engagement
→ People click your profile
→ They see good bio + interesting content
→ They follow

KEY INSIGHT: Follows and likes are PASSIVE. They don't grow YOUR followers.
What grows followers:
1. REPLIES on high-visibility posts (biggest ROI)
2. QUOTE TWEETS (your take reaches both audiences)
3. BEING EARLY on big account posts (top reply placement)
4. STRONG TAKES that trigger engagement (controversy = visibility)
5. HUMOR that gets likes (funny replies go viral)

PRIORITY ORDER:
1. Reply to viral posts (1K+ likes) — 50% of time
2. Quote tweet trending posts — 15% of time
3. Original posts/threads — 15% of time
4. News-reactive content — 10% of time
5. Everything else (follows, likes, reciprocity) — 10% of time
```

## Daily Algorithm (3 Sessions)

### Session 1: Morning (30-40 min) — HIGHEST PRIORITY

```
1. NEWS CHECK (NEW — 5 min)
   Scan for breaking news:
   ├── open "https://x.com/search?q=breaking OR announced OR just launched&f=live"
   ├── Check top trending topics
   ├── If major news in AI/tech/startups → react FAST (first 2-4 hours matters)
   ├── If news in other domain where you have angle → react
   └── Draft 1-2 news-reactive posts/replies

2. VIRAL POST HUNTING (HIGHEST PRIORITY — 15 min)
   Search ACROSS domains (not just AI):
   ├── AI/Tech: "AI agents OR Claude OR GPT OR coding" (min_faves:1000)
   ├── Startups: "startup OR founder OR shipped OR built" (min_faves:500)
   ├── Career: "career OR quit OR hired OR fired" (min_faves:1000)
   ├── Humor: "developers OR engineers OR coding" (min_faves:2000)
   ├── India: "India tech OR Bangalore OR startup India" (min_faves:500)
   ├── Trending: Check what's actually trending right now
   │
   ├── Find posts with 1K+ likes across ALL these domains
   ├── Reply with strong, specific takes (5-15 words)
   ├── Include HUMOR replies — not every reply needs to be insightful
   ├── Target: 8-12 replies on viral posts
   └── GOAL: Get YOUR reply liked → profile visits → follows

   Post selection criteria (UPDATED):
   ├── 1K+ likes (high visibility)
   ├── Posted <6 hours ago (still getting traffic)
   ├── YOU have something SPECIFIC to add (experience, data, humor, unique angle)
   ├── Few quality replies yet (your reply can stand out)
   └── NOT limited to AI/tech — any domain where you can contribute

3. TARGET ACCOUNT SWEEP (10 min)
   For each TIER 1 account (8-12):
   ├── open "https://x.com/{username}"
   ├── Check their MOST RECENT post
   ├── If posted <2 hours ago → reply IMMEDIATELY (early = top placement)
   ├── Match their energy: humor on humor, serious on serious
   └── Skip if post is old (your reply will be buried)

4. ORIGINAL CONTENT (5 min)
   Rotate across content pillars (NOT always AI):
   ├── Mon: AI/tech insight from SalesMonk
   ├── Tue: Career story or hot take
   ├── Wed: Indian tech scene observation or humor
   ├── Thu: News commentary or opinion
   ├── Fri: Random life observation or book/fitness post
   ├── Sat: Build-in-public update or shipping story
   └── Sun: Reflective/personal post
```

### Session 2: Afternoon (20-25 min)

```
5. TREND SURFING — MULTI-DOMAIN (15 min)
   Hunt for high-visibility reply opportunities ACROSS domains:

   Search rotation (cycle through these):
   ├── "min_faves:500 lang:en" + current trending topic

6. CHECK YOUR POST PERFORMANCE (5 min)
   open "https://x.com/{your_handle}"
   ├── Reply to every comment (keeps thread active)
   ├── If doing well → quote tweet with extra thought
   └── If not → analyze why and adjust

7. QUOTE TWEETS (5 min)
   ├── 2-3 QTs with strong takes
   ├── Add humor or contrarian angle
   ├── NOT just resharing — add your take
   └── Can be non-AI topics
```

### Session 3: Evening (15-20 min)

```
8. LINKEDIN ENGAGEMENT (10 min)
   ├── Comment on 5-8 trending LinkedIn posts
   ├── Mix of AI + career + startup + Indian ecosystem posts
   ├── Add specific experience, not generic praise

    ├── Find 2-3 new accounts to follow
    ├── Support people at your level
    └── Build growth cohort
```

## Reply Decision Tree (v2 — Multi-Domain)

```
See a post →
├── Can you add something SPECIFIC? (experience, data, humor, unique angle)
│   ├── No (only generic response possible) → Skip
│   └── Yes ↓
├── What domain is it?
│   ├── AI/Tech → "Built this / shipped this / saw this in production" angle
│   ├── Startup/Career → Career zigzag story angle
│   ├── Indian ecosystem → Local perspective / BITS connection angle
│   ├── Humor/Culture → Match energy, add reframe or parallel
│   ├── News → Personal impact / what this means for builders angle
│   ├── Business/Economy → Connect to startup experience angle
│   └── Life/Random → Personal observation (be a human, not an account)
├── Is there a natural humor angle?
│   ├── Yes → Use it! Funny replies get more likes = more profile visits
│   └── No → Use experience/insight angle
├── How long should it be?
│   ├── X reply: 5-15 words ideal, max 280 chars
│   ├── X quote tweet: 3-10 words of your take
│   ├── LinkedIn comment: 1-3 sentences, specific
│   └── Original post: varies by content type
└── Draft reply → CONTENT REVIEW GATE → Post

KEY RULE: The ONLY filter is "can I add something SPECIFIC?"
NOT "is this in my niche?" — you are a person, not a topic.
```

   ├── Do I have a SPECIFIC angle on this?
   │   ├── Personal experience related? → React with story
   │   ├── Domain expertise relevant? → React with insight
   │   ├── Funny angle possible? → React with humor
   │   └── None of the above? → SKIP (don't be generic)
   └── Am I early enough? (First 4 hours = worth it, after 12 hours = skip)

3. React (2 min):
   ├── Option A: Reply to the biggest post about it (ride the wave)
   ├── Option B: Quote tweet with your angle
   └── Option C: Original post with your take

## Content Review Gate (Same as v1 + additions)

**Every piece of content MUST pass through this review loop before posting.**

### Editor Checklist (ALL must pass)

**1. Persona Alignment (UPDATED)**
- [ ] Sounds like Prateek — builder with opinions, not just an AI expert
- [ ] References real experience when relevant
- [ ] Matches the voice: direct, opinionated, casual but properly capitalized
- [ ] Has personality — humor, warmth, or edge (not just information)
- [ ] Could ONLY be written by you — not by any random tech person

**2. Context Match (MOST IMPORTANT)**
- [ ] Reply addresses the SPECIFIC content of the post
- [ ] Adds value — not just agreement or generic praise
- [ ] Tone matches: humor on humor, serious on serious
- [ ] If disagreeing, has substance
- [ ] IMAGE/VIDEO RULE: Can't see media → DON'T reply
- [ ] SPECIFICITY TEST: Could go on 10+ similar posts? → Too generic, rewrite
- [ ] Check top comments first

**3. Domain Expansion Check (NEW)**
- [ ] NOT every reply needs to be about AI/tech
- [ ] If replying to non-tech post: does the reply show personality?
- [ ] If humor: is it natural, not forced?
- [ ] If news: do you have a genuine angle?
- [ ] Mix check: are you replying across multiple domains today?

**4. Anti-AI Detection (unchanged)**
- [ ] Zero banned phrases
- [ ] No perfect parallel structure
- [ ] Not relentlessly positive
- [ ] Has natural language markers
- [ ] Passes the 95/100 test

**5. Platform-Specific Rules (unchanged)**
- X: under 280 chars, no hashtags, casual with proper caps
- LinkedIn: professional but human, hook in first 2 lines

## Safety Limits (unchanged)

### Daily Maximums (Conservative — New Account <1mo)

| Action | Max/Day |
|--------|---------|
| Follows | 15-20 |
| Likes | 30-50 |
| Replies | 20-30 |
| Posts | 2-3 |

### Red Flags to Avoid
- Same reply text to multiple posts
- Replying to same account 3+ times in a row
- Following then unfollowing
- Engaging at perfectly regular intervals
- Engaging 24/7 (pick realistic hours)

---

## Metrics to Track

### Weekly Review

| Metric | Target | How |
|--------|--------|-----|
| Follower growth | +50-100/week once rolling | Profile page |
| Profile visits | Increasing week over week | Analytics |
| Reply engagement | Some replies getting 5+ likes | Check your replies |
| Content mix | No more than 40% AI-only | Audit your last 20 posts |
| Domain diversity | Posts/replies in 4+ domains | Audit your last 20 posts |

### What to Optimize

**If not growing:**
1. Are you ONLY posting about AI? → Diversify
2. Are your replies funny/interesting or just "insightful"? → Add humor
3. Are you engaging with trending non-AI posts? → Expand scope
4. Do people feel like they KNOW you? → Add personal content
5. Are you reacting to news fast enough? → Set up monitoring

**If growing slowly:**
- Normal for first 3-6 months
- Focus on reply quality over quantity
- Get X Premium (algorithmic boost for replies)
- Build deeper relationships with growth cohort
