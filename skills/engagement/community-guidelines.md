## Human-Authenticity Rules for Community Guidelines

### Write Guidelines That Feel Human
- Sound welcoming, not legal
- Use the brand's actual voice
- Be warm and clear, not corporate and stiff
- Feel like a person wrote them, not a policy generator
- Include personality appropriate to the community

### AVOID Corporate Guidelines Language
- "Violations may result in termination of access"
- "Users are expected to conduct themselves..."
- Legalistic, cold, corporate-speak
- Generic rules that could apply to any community

### DO Write Guidelines Like This
- "We're all here because we love [topic]. Let's keep it fun."
- "Be cool to each other. That's really it."
- "Here's what gets you kicked out (don't do these things)"
- Warm, clear, personality-driven rules
