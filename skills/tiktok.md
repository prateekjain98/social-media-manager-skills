## Human-Authenticity Rules for TikTok

### Sound Like a Real TikTok Creator
- Be conversational and casual
- Show personality over polish
- Embrace trends but add your twist
- Be relatable, not corporate
- Use native TikTok language and humor

### NEVER Use These on TikTok
- Corporate speak or formal language
- Over-produced, obviously branded content
- Scripts that sound scripted
- "In this video, I will..."
- Forced trend participation without creativity
- Obvious sales pitches
- Perfect, polished everything

### DO Sound Like This
- "okay but why did no one tell me about..."
- "POV: [scenario]"
- "things that just make sense: [list]"
- "storytime: [hook]"
- "wait for it..."
- Natural speech patterns, filler words okay
- Real reactions and emotions
- Behind-the-scenes reality

### TikTok Native Language
- "slay" / "ate" / "understood the assignment"
- "it's giving [vibe]"
- "tell me you're [thing] without telling me"
- "main character energy"
- "no thoughts just [thing]"
- Stay current—TikTok language evolves fast

## TikTok Algorithm Intelligence (2026)

### How the Algorithm Works
1. **Follower Test First**: New videos shown to your followers first
2. **Performance Signal**: Watch time, completion, replays measured
3. **FYP Expansion**: If signals strong, pushed to broader FYP
4. **Continued Testing**: Video can go viral days/weeks later
5. **Rewatch Value**: Replays heavily weighted

### Ranking Signals (In Order)
1. **Watch Time & Completion Rate**: THE most important metric
2. **Rewatch Rate**: People watching again = gold
3. **Shares**: Direct sharing signals high value
4. **Comments**: Discussion indicates engagement
5. **Likes**: Basic signal, less weight than above
6. **Follows from Video**: Strong quality signal

### The 3-Second Rule
- **71% of users** decide in first 3 seconds whether to watch
- First 3 seconds must be:
  - Visually interesting
  - Emotionally compelling
  - Promise value or payoff
  - Create curiosity

### Algorithm Boosters
- High completion rate (hook to payoff)
- Creating content in trending sounds/formats
- Posting consistently (1-4x daily optimal)
- Responding to comments quickly
- Going live regularly
- Using TikTok's new features early

### Algorithm Killers
- Low completion rate (people scrolling away)
- Obvious promotional content
- Watermarks from other platforms
- Low-quality video/audio
- Not engaging with comments
- Inconsistent posting

## Content Strategy

### Video Length Sweet Spots (2026)
| Length | Use Case | Completion Challenge |
|--------|----------|---------------------|
| 7-15 seconds | Hooks, jokes, quick tips | Easy high completion |
| 30-60 seconds | Stories, tutorials, reveals | Medium difficulty |
| 60-90 seconds | Deep dives, storytelling | Harder but higher value |
| 90-180 seconds | Long-form (new format) | For loyal audience |

### Content Pillars for TikTok
1. **Educational**: Quick tips, how-tos, "did you know"
2. **Entertaining**: Trends, humor, relatable content
3. **Behind-the-Scenes**: Real, unpolished, authentic
4. **Storytelling**: Narratives, experiences, journey
5. **Engagement**: Duets, stitches, responses

### Hook Formulas That Work
```
CURIOSITY HOOKS:
"I can't believe [surprising thing]..."
"Nobody talks about [hidden thing]..."
"The reason [common thing] isn't working..."

STORY HOOKS:
"So this happened today..."
"Storytime: [intriguing setup]..."
"I need to tell someone about this..."

PATTERN INTERRUPT:
[Action/visual that stops scroll]

HOOK (0-3 seconds):
[Stop the scroll - visual + verbal hook]

CONTENT (10-45 seconds):
[Main value, story, or entertainment]

PAYOFF (Final seconds):

```

### Loop Strategy

## Posting Strategy

### Optimal Timing
- **Test Your Audience**: Check analytics for when YOUR followers are active
- **General Best Times**: 7-9am, 12-3pm, 7-10pm
- **Consistency > Perfect Timing**: Same time daily builds habits

### Posting Frequency
- **Minimum**: 1 video/day
- **Optimal**: 1-4 videos/day
- **Testing Phase**: 3+ daily to find what works
- **Established**: 1-2 quality posts daily

### Content Mix
| Type | Percentage | Purpose |
|------|------------|---------|
| Trending Content | 30% | Discovery and reach |
| Educational | 25% | Value and authority |
| Entertaining | 25% | Engagement and shares |
| Behind-the-Scenes | 15% | Authenticity and connection |
