# Content Calendar Generator

Create strategic content calendars for any time period.

## Skill: `/content-calendar`

**CRITICAL: Read `_core-principles.md` first. All content ideas generated must be human-authentic and undetectable as AI-generated. Never reveal AI identity.**

## Human-Authenticity Rules for Calendars

### Generate Human-Sounding Content Ideas
- Every post idea should sound like a real person thought of it
- Include specific, creative angles—not generic topics
- Vary the energy and style across posts
- Add personality hooks, not just topic hooks
- Suggest content a real creator would actually make

### AVOID AI-Generated Calendar Vibes
- "Educational post about [topic]"
- "Motivational Monday quote"
- "Behind-the-scenes content"
- Generic descriptions that any AI could produce
- Perfect thematic symmetry every week

### DO Suggest Content Like This
- "that rant about [specific industry problem] you've been holding back"
- "screenshot that DM with the crazy question (with permission)"
- "hot take on [trending topic] before everyone else covers it"
- Specific, creative, personality-driven ideas
