# Follower Growth Agent

Real strategies for growing your social media following. No BS, no generic advice. What actually works.

## Skill: `/growth-agent`

**CRITICAL: Read these first:**
- `_core-principles.md` - Core writing principles
- `_persona.md` - Your professional identity and positioning
- `agent-browser.md` - Browser automation commands

---

## Your Positioning Advantage

Read `_persona.md` for your full background and positioning. Key principle: you're not starting from zero — you have real experience building products. Your strategy is to transfer that credibility to new platforms.

When engaging, you're sharing what you've learned from building, not asking for advice.

## Let's Be Honest First

Most "growth hacking" advice is garbage. Here's the truth:

**What Actually Matters:**
- Being genuinely interesting or useful
- Showing up consistently (months, not weeks)
- Building real relationships with 20-50 key people in your niche
- Having opinions that aren't vanilla
- Creating content YOU would actually want to read

**What Barely Matters (despite what everyone says):**
- Posting at "optimal times" - maybe 5% difference
- Hashtags on X/LinkedIn - negligible impact
- Perfect formatting - content > presentation
- Follower/following ratio - nobody checks anymore

**What Will Kill Your Account:**
- Follow/unfollow games - platforms detect this instantly
- Engagement pods - flagged and penalized
- Buying followers - destroys your reach permanently
- Spammy DMs - account restrictions guaranteed
- Generic comments - "Great post!" does nothing

---

## The Real Growth Flywheel

Forget the fancy diagrams. Here's how growth actually works:

```
1. You post something interesting
2. A bigger account notices (because you've been engaging with them)
3. They engage with your content
4. Their audience sees you
5. Some check your profile
6. If your profile/content is good, they follow
7. Repeat 1000 times
```

That's it. There's no hack. It's just doing this over and over until it compounds.

## The Uncomfortable Truth About Time

**How long this actually takes:**

| Starting Point | Time to 10K | What It Takes |
|----------------|-------------|---------------|
| 0 followers | 12-18 months | 2-3 hours/day, every day |
| 1K followers | 6-12 months | 1-2 hours/day |
| 5K followers | 3-6 months | 1 hour/day |

Anyone telling you faster is either lying, got lucky, or already had an audience elsewhere.

The people who fail? They quit at month 2 when they're still at 500 followers.

## Platform-Specific Reality Checks

### X (Twitter) - The Real Game

**What Actually Works:**

1. **Be a Reply Guy (The Right Way)**

   Not "Great post!" - that's useless. Instead:
   - Add something the original poster didn't say
   - Share a related experience
   - Respectfully challenge with reasoning
   - Ask a question that makes people think

   ```
   BAD: "Love this! 🔥"

   GOOD: "This happened to me last year. The part nobody
   talks about is [specific insight]. Changed how I
   think about [topic]."
   ```

2. **The First 5 Minutes Rule**

   When a big account posts, the first replies get the most visibility. Not because of any algorithm trick - just because more people see them as they scroll through comments.

   Pick 5-10 accounts in your niche. Turn on notifications. When they post, reply within 5 minutes with something actually valuable.

3. **Quote Tweet Yourself**

   Posted something that's doing well? 4-6 hours later, quote tweet it with:
   - A hotter take
   - "One thing I forgot to mention..."
   - A counter-argument to your own point

   This doubles your reach on content that's already working.

4. **Thread Strategy (If You're Going to Do It)**

   Most threads suck because they're padded garbage. Here's what works:

   ```
   Tweet 1: Bold claim that makes people go "wait, what?"
   Tweet 2-3: The problem (why this matters to them)
   Tweet 4-7: Your actual insights (no filler)
   Tweet 8: The proof (your results, data, example)
   Tweet 9: Recap in one sentence + "Retweet if useful"

   That's it. 9 tweets max. Everything else is padding.
   ```

5. **The "Mutual" Strategy**

   Find 10-20 accounts at roughly your level (similar followers, same niche). Become actual friends with them. Engage with their stuff consistently. They'll engage with yours. You grow together.

   This isn't an engagement pod. It's called "making friends online."

**What's Overrated on X:**

- Posting 10+ times a day (quality > quantity)
- Perfectly formatted tweets (substance > style)
- "Viral" content (consistency > spikes)
- Following "influencers" (they don't follow back or engage)

### How Top Devs Actually Engage (Research from @rauchg, @theo, @ThePrimeagen)

**What they actually do:**
- "Thank you! Will fix" (Rauch)
- "🫡" (Theo - literally just an emoji)
- "5.3 > 4.6 > 3" (Theo - assumes you get it)
- "it would be funny if 5.3 is just 5.2 and it's an experiment to see how much psychosis there really is" (Prime)
- "Well unfortunately I make my tweets because I think they're funny" (Prime)

**The pattern:**
| What works | What sucks |
|------------|------------|
| 5-15 words | 40+ word essays |
| lowercase, casual | Proper LinkedIn sentences |
| assume knowledge | explain everything |
| react, don't teach | "adding value" lectures |
| sarcasm, humor | serious "insights" |
| context-specific | template vibes |

**Your reply style should be:**

```
BAD (what I wrote before):
"Shipped a fitness app with React Native. The real win: sharing
code patterns with our Next.js web app. When you're already in
the TS/React ecosystem, context switching to Dart isn't worth it."

GOOD:
"rn all the way. built our app on it - onboarding new devs was
way faster since they already knew react. watched a flutter
project die from the dart learning curve"

ALSO GOOD:
"this"
"^^ exactly this"
"been saying this for years"
"the dart learning curve killed a project i saw"
"rn. not even close."
```

**The vibe:**
- You're texting a friend, not writing a blog post
- Lowercase is fine
- No need to explain who you are
- If you need more than 2 sentences, you're overthinking it
- Humor > "value"
- React to the specific thing, don't generalize

**Daily Routine That Actually Works:**

```
MORNING (20-30 min):
- Check notifications, reply to everyone who engaged
- Find 3-5 new posts from target accounts, reply thoughtfully
- Post 1 piece of content (something YOU find interesting)

AFTERNOON (10-15 min):
- Check if morning post is getting traction
- If yes: engage with commenters, quote tweet with more
- If no: don't overthink it, move on

EVENING (15-20 min):
- 3-5 more quality replies on trending posts in niche
- Engage with mutuals
- Maybe post one more thing if you have something worth saying
```

### LinkedIn - Different Beast Entirely

**The Reality of LinkedIn 2026:**

LinkedIn's algorithm changed. It now rewards "depth over breadth." This means:
- Niche expertise beats general content
- Comments matter more than likes (by a lot)
- Carousels/documents get more time-on-content
- External links tank your reach (put them in comments)

**What Actually Works:**

1. **Pick ONE Topic and Own It**

   LinkedIn now fast-tracks people who consistently talk about one specific thing. "Marketing" is too broad. "B2B SaaS email marketing for Series A startups" is specific.

   Every post should reinforce: "This person is THE person for [specific topic]"

2. **The Pre-Engagement Warmup**

   15 minutes before you post, go comment on 5-10 posts in your feed. Thoughtful comments, not "Great insight!"

   Why? When you post right after, LinkedIn's already registered you as "active and engaging" - they push your content harder.

3. **Document Posts (Carousels)**

   These work because people swipe through them, which increases "dwell time" - a key metric LinkedIn tracks.

   Structure:
   ```
   Slide 1: Hook (bold statement or question)
   Slide 2: The problem/pain point
   Slides 3-8: Your framework/solution (one idea per slide)
   Slide 9: Summary
   Slide 10: CTA + your handle
   ```

4. **The Golden Hour**

   The first 60 minutes after posting are critical. Stay online. Reply to every single comment within 5 minutes. Ask follow-up questions. Keep the conversation going.

   LinkedIn interprets this as "high quality content" and pushes it further.

5. **Connection Requests That Work**

   ```
   "Hey [Name], saw your post about [specific topic] -
   particularly the part about [specific detail].
   I work in [related field] and would love to connect
   and follow your thinking on this."
   ```

   Never:
   - Blank requests
   - "I'd like to add you to my network"
   - Immediate sales pitch after connecting

**Daily LinkedIn Routine:**

```
MORNING (before posting):
- Comment on 5-10 posts (genuine insights)
- Reply to any DMs/comments from yesterday

POST (once per day is fine):
- One quality post (story > tips > opinion > promotion)

GOLDEN HOUR (60 min after post):
- Reply to every comment
- Like comments, ask follow-ups
- Stay engaged

THROUGHOUT DAY:
- Accept connections, send personalized welcome
- Comment on a few more posts
- Check who viewed your profile, connect if relevant
```

---

### Instagram - The Shares Game

**The 2026 Reality:**

Instagram now prioritizes:
1. Sends (people sharing to DMs) - by far the most important
2. Saves
3. Comments
4. Likes (barely matters anymore)

This means: create content people want to share with their friends.

**What Actually Works:**

1. **Make Share-Worthy Content**

   Before posting, ask: "Would someone actually send this to a friend?"

   Share-worthy content:
   - Relatable situations ("me when...")
   - Useful tips someone would save for later
   - Controversial takes they'd share for discussion
   - Beautiful/inspiring stuff (for aesthetic niches)

2. **Reels Are Non-Negotiable**

   Like it or not, Reels get 3-5x the reach of static posts. If you're not doing video, you're leaving growth on the table.

   The first 3 seconds determine everything. If people scroll past in the first 3 seconds, Instagram kills your reach.

3. **Story Engagement Is Underrated**

   Replying to other people's stories puts you in their DMs. It's personal. It builds relationships. Those people become your engaged followers.

   Not "🔥" - actual replies. "Where was this taken?" or "I tried this and [experience]"

4. **The Hashtag Reality**

   Hashtags matter less than they used to. Use 3-5 relevant ones, don't overthink it. The algorithm reads your content now, not your hashtags.

## The Agent-Browser Execution

> **Browser mode:** On macOS, use Safari/AppleScript patterns from `agent-browser.md`.
> CDP commands below require Chrome running with `--remote-debugging-port=9222`.
> For full executable sessions, use `/grow-followers` — it's the purpose-built runbook.

Now let's talk about automating the non-creative parts. The key: automate research and navigation, but keep engagement authentic.

### What to Automate

✅ **Good to Automate:**
- Finding posts from target accounts
- Navigating to profiles
- Searching for leads/opportunities
- Taking snapshots of what to engage with
- Tracking who you've engaged with

❌ **Never Automate:**
- The actual reply content (write it yourself or use this skill to generate human-like responses)
- Mass following
- Mass liking
- Identical messages

### Daily Session: X Growth

```bash
# Morning: Find posts to engage with
agent-browser --cdp 9222 open "https://x.com/[TARGET_ACCOUNT]"
sleep 3
agent-browser --cdp 9222 snapshot -i

# Review their latest tweets, pick ones worth replying to
# Navigate to the tweet
agent-browser --cdp 9222 click @[TWEET_REF]
sleep 2
agent-browser --cdp 9222 snapshot -i

# Now MANUALLY think about what to say
# Or use this skill: "Write a genuine reply to: [tweet content]"
# Then type it:
agent-browser --cdp 9222 fill @[REPLY_INPUT] "[YOUR_THOUGHTFUL_REPLY]"
sleep 2
agent-browser --cdp 9222 click @[POST_BUTTON]

# Wait 45-90 seconds (random) before next engagement
sleep $((RANDOM % 45 + 45))

# Repeat for 5-10 target accounts
```

### Finding Opportunities

```bash
# Find people looking for your services
agent-browser --cdp 9222 open "https://x.com/search?q=%22looking%20for%22%20%22[YOUR_SKILL]%22&f=live"
agent-browser --cdp 9222 snapshot

# Review results, engage genuinely (not pitch-slapping)
```

### Safety Timing

Real humans don't act like robots. Build in variance:

```bash
# Random delay function (45-120 seconds)
sleep $((RANDOM % 75 + 45))

# Sometimes take longer breaks (like checking another tab)
if [ $((RANDOM % 5)) -eq 0 ]; then
  sleep $((RANDOM % 180 + 120))  # 2-5 minute break
fi
```

---

## The Real Daily Limits

> **Canonical source:** See `strategy/_growth-algorithm.md` > Safety Limits for all rate limits by growth phase (Phase 1/2/3).
> Do not define local limits here — they will drift and conflict.

**Key principle:** These are conservative because getting restricted kills your growth for weeks. For new accounts, use Phase 1 limits.

---

## What Actually Moves the Needle

After all the tactics, here's what separates people who grow from people who don't:

1. **Consistency Over Intensity**

   Showing up every day for a year beats going hard for a month and burning out.

2. **Genuine Curiosity**

   The best engagement comes from being actually interested in what others are saying. If you're faking it, people can tell.

3. **A Clear Identity**

   When someone lands on your profile, they should know within 3 seconds what you're about. Confusing = unfollow.

4. **Opinions That Aren't Vanilla**

   "Hard work pays off" isn't interesting. "Here's why I think hustle culture is actually holding back most founders" is.

5. **Playing the Long Game**

   Most people give up before compound interest kicks in. The ones who stick around for 18+ months see the hockey stick.

---

## Tracking What Matters

Stop obsessing over follower count. Track these instead:

| Metric | Why It Matters | How to Measure |
|--------|----------------|----------------|
| Engagement Rate | Quality of audience | Engagements ÷ Impressions |
| Profile Visits | Are people curious about you? | Analytics |
| Profile → Follow Rate | Is your profile compelling? | New followers ÷ Profile visits |
| Replies from Target Accounts | Are the right people noticing you? | Manual tracking |
| DM Conversations | Real relationships building? | Count per week |

Follower count is a vanity metric. An account with 5K engaged followers beats 50K ghosts every time.

---

## When Things Aren't Working

If you've been at it for 3+ months and seeing no growth:

1. **Your Content Might Be Boring**

   Ask 5 people in your target audience: "Would you follow someone posting this?" If they hesitate, that's your answer.

2. **You're Not Engaging Enough**

   Remember the 70/30 rule. Most people create too much and engage too little.

3. **You're in the Wrong Niche**

   Some niches just don't grow well on certain platforms. B2B on TikTok is hard. Lifestyle on LinkedIn is hard. Pick your battles.

4. **Your Profile Sucks**

   Your bio should answer: Who are you? Who do you help? Why should I care? If it doesn't, fix it before anything else.

5. **You're Being Impatient**

   Seriously, most people quit too early. The first 1K followers are the hardest. It gets easier after that.

---

## The Bottom Line

There's no secret. There's no hack. There's just:

1. Create content worth following
2. Engage with people worth knowing
3. Be consistent for longer than feels reasonable
4. Don't be annoying

That's the entire strategy. Everything else is optimization on the margins.

Now go do the work.
