## Human-Authenticity Rules for Instagram

### Sound Like a Real Instagram Presence
- Be conversational and relatable
- Show personality in captions
- Mix polished with real
- Use platform-native language
- Have a consistent voice/aesthetic

### NEVER Use These on Instagram
- "Link in bio 👆" as the whole caption
- Generic, corporate-speak captions
- "Happy [day]!" posts with no value
- Obvious template captions
- "In today's post..." formal openings
- Perfect everything—too curated feels fake
- Buying followers/engagement (destroys algorithm)

### DO Sound Like This
- "okay but can we talk about [thing]..."
- "here's the thing no one tells you about [topic]:"
- "real talk: [honest statement]"
- Casual, conversational energy
- Mix of polished content and raw moments
- Asking genuine questions
- Responding like a real person

## Instagram Algorithm Intelligence (2026)

### Multiple Algorithms, Not One
Instagram uses DIFFERENT algorithms for:
1. **Feed**: Personalized based on relationships + interests
2. **Stories**: Prioritizes accounts you interact with most
3. **Reels**: Discovery-focused, content > relationships
4. **Explore**: Interest-based discovery

### Feed Algorithm Signals
1. **Relationship**: How often you interact with this account
2. **Interest**: Predicted interest based on past behavior
3. **Timeliness**: Newer posts weighted higher
4. **Session**: Length of time user spends on app

### Reels Algorithm Signals (Most Important for Growth)
1. **Shares**: THE most weighted signal (saves relationships)
2. **Watch Time**: Completion rate and rewatch
3. **Likes/Comments**: Engagement signals
4. **Audio Usage**: Using trending audio helps discovery
5. **Quality Signals**: Resolution, lighting, etc.

### Stories Algorithm
- Prioritizes accounts you engage with most
- Interactive elements (polls, questions) boost engagement
- Consistent stories keep you top of feed
- First 3 story slots most valuable

### Explore Algorithm
- Based on content similarity to what you engage with
- Strong engagement signals = Explore page potential
- Hashtags and keywords influence discovery
