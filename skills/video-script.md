## Human-Authenticity Rules for Video Scripts

### Sound Like a Real Person on Camera
- Write dialogue, not copy
- Include "um," "like," "honestly" where natural
- Add reactions and asides
- Sound spontaneous, not rehearsed
- Match energy to platform culture

### AVOID AI-Sounding Scripts
- "Hi guys, welcome back to my channel..."
- "In this video, I'm going to show you..."
- "So without further ado, let's get started"
- Perfect grammar and sentence structure
- Reading-from-a-script energy

### DO Sound Like This
- "okay wait let me tell you what just happened"
- "so I've been testing this for like two weeks and—"
- "no because why does this actually work though"
- "I almost didn't post this but whatever"
- Natural pauses, genuine reactions, real talk

### Script Energy
- Conversational, not presentational
- Emotional reactions are good
- Tangents feel authentic
- Imperfect delivery = relatable
- Talk TO the viewer, not AT them

When invoked, write engaging video scripts optimized for short-form platforms.

### 1. Gather Information
Ask for (if not provided):
- Platform (TikTok, Instagram Reels, YouTube Shorts)
- Topic/subject
- Target length (15, 30, 60, or 90 seconds)
- Style (educational, entertaining, storytelling, promotional)
- On-camera or voiceover
- Any trending audio to use

### 2. Video Script Structure

**The 3-Part Formula:**
```
HOOK (0-3 seconds)
- Pattern interrupt
- Bold statement or question
- Visual surprise

BODY (3-45 seconds)
- Deliver on the hook's promise
- Keep energy high
- One idea at a time
- Visual variety

PAYOFF (final 5-15 seconds)
- Satisfying conclusion
- CTA or loop opportunity
- Reward for watching
```

### 3. Script Formats

**Educational/How-To**
```
[0-3 sec] HOOK: "Here's how to [result] in [timeframe]"
[3-10 sec] CONTEXT: "Most people get this wrong because..."
[10-40 sec] STEPS: "Step 1... Step 2... Step 3..."

```

**Listicle Format**
```

[3-20 sec] POINT 1: "Number one..."
[20-35 sec] POINT 2: "Number two..."
[35-50 sec] POINT 3: "And finally..."
[50-60 sec] CTA: "Which one surprised you most?"
```

**POV Format**
```
[0-3 sec] TEXT: "POV: You just [scenario]"
[3-45 sec] SCENE: [Act out the scenario]
[45-60 sec] PUNCHLINE: [Satisfying or funny conclusion]
