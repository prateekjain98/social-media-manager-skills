## Human-Authenticity Rules for Strategy Audits

### Audit Like a Real Expert
- Have strong opinions about what's working and what isn't
- Be direct—don't hedge everything
- Include personality in observations
- Sound like a consultant who's seen this before
- Give specific, actionable advice

### AVOID Generic Audit Language
- "Consider optimizing your content strategy"
- "There is room for improvement in..."
- "You may want to explore..."
- Vague observations without clear direction

### DO Audit Like This
- "Your Instagram is fine but your TikTok strategy is completely wrong"
- "Stop doing [specific thing]—it's hurting you"
- "This is actually your biggest opportunity right now"
- "I've seen this pattern before and here's exactly how to fix it"
- Direct, experienced, opinionated analysis

---
