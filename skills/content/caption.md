# Caption Generator

Generate engaging social media captions optimized for any platform.

## Skill: `/caption`

**CRITICAL: Read `_core-principles.md` first. All content must be human-authentic and undetectable as AI-generated. Never reveal AI identity.**

---

## Persona-Specific Content

**If generating content for a specific persona (e.g., Prateek Jain), use `/create-post` instead.**
This skill (`/caption`) is for generic, non-persona content only.

For Prateek's LinkedIn/X content:
- Full workflow: `skills/content/create-post.md`
- Voice guide: `personas/prateek/content/linkedin-persona.md`
- Examples: `personas/prateek/content/weekly-posts.md`

## Human-Authenticity Rules for Captions

### Write Like a Real Person
- Use conversational language, not marketing speak
- Include imperfections (fragments, casual phrases)
- Have opinions and personality
- Sound spontaneous, not manufactured
- Vary structure unpredictably

### NEVER Use These AI Giveaways
- "Let's dive in..."
- "In today's world..."
- "Game-changer"
- "Unlock your potential"
- "Take it to the next level"
- Perfect parallel structure in lists
- Overly enthusiastic exclamation marks!!!

### DO Sound Like This
- "okay but can we talk about..."
- "honestly? [opinion]"
- "here's the thing nobody tells you..."
- "I've been doing this for years and..."
- Lowercase for casual platforms
- Real opinions, even controversial ones

---

When invoked, follow these steps:

### 1. Gather Information
Ask for (if not provided):
- Platform (Instagram, TikTok, LinkedIn, Twitter, etc.)
- Topic/subject of the post
- Goal (engagement, traffic, sales, awareness)
- Brand voice (professional, casual, playful, etc.)
- Any specific CTAs needed

### 2. Caption Structure

**Instagram/TikTok:**
```
[Hook - first line that stops the scroll]

[Value/Story - main content with line breaks]

[CTA - clear call to action]

[Hashtags - 5-15 relevant hashtags]
```

**LinkedIn:**
```
[Hook - compelling first 2 lines before "see more"]

[Body - insights with single-sentence paragraphs]

[CTA - question or action]

[Hashtags - 3-5 at end]
```

**Twitter:**
```
[Concise hook + value in 280 characters]
[Thread format for longer content]
```

### 3. Hook Types to Use
- Question hooks: "What if everything you knew about X was wrong?"
- Controversial hooks: "Unpopular opinion: [statement]"
- Story hooks: "3 years ago, I was [situation]..."
- Curiosity hooks: "Nobody talks about this, but..."
- Value hooks: "Save this for later:"
- Number hooks: "5 ways to [achieve result]"

### 4. Best Practices
- Front-load value in the first line
- Use line breaks for readability
- Include specific numbers and results when possible
- End with engagement-driving CTA
- Match tone to brand voice
- Optimize for platform character limits

### 5. Output Format
Provide 3 caption variations:
1. **Engagement-focused** - Designed to maximize comments
2. **Value-focused** - Educational/informative approach
3. **Story-focused** - Narrative/emotional approach

For each, include:
- The full caption
- Suggested hashtags (if applicable)
- Why this approach works

### Example Output

**Request:** Instagram caption for a coffee shop announcing a new seasonal latte

**Variation 1 (Engagement):**
```
Controversial take: Pumpkin spice is overrated.

That's why we created something better.

**Why it works:** Opens with controversy to stop scrolls, builds anticipation, ends with engagement question.
