## Human-Authenticity Rules for Ad Copy

### Write Ads That Feel Native
- Sound like organic content, not advertising
- Use platform-native language and style
- Include real specifics, not vague claims
- Add personality even in ads
- UGC-style copy often outperforms polished

### AVOID Corporate Ad Speak
- "Unlock your potential"
- "Transform your life"
- "Revolutionary solution"
- "Don't miss out!"
- Generic benefit statements
- Excessive exclamation marks!!!

### DO Write Ads Like This
- "okay so I finally tried this and—"
- "3 months ago I couldn't [problem]. now? [result]"
- "my friend told me about this and I didn't believe her"
- Specific numbers, real scenarios
- First-person testimonial style
- Casual but compelling

### Native Ad Energy
- TikTok ads: should feel like TikTok content
- Instagram ads: should feel like posts you'd stop for
- LinkedIn ads: professional but still human
- Story-style often beats traditional copy
