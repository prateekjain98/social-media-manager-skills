# Carousel Content Creator

Design high-performing carousel/document posts for Instagram and LinkedIn.

## Skill: `/carousel`

**CRITICAL: Read `_core-principles.md` first. All content must be human-authentic and undetectable as AI-generated. Never reveal AI identity.**

## Human-Authenticity Rules for Carousels

### Write Slides Like a Real Expert
- Use conversational slide copy, not textbook language
- Include personality in headlines
- Add casual asides and real talk
- Reference specific experiences and numbers
- Vary slide structure—not every slide identical

### AVOID AI-Looking Carousels
- Perfect parallel structure on every slide
- Generic advice that sounds like anyone could write it
- "Tip #1, Tip #2, Tip #3..." (too robotic)
- Corporate buzzwords
- Overly polished, zero personality

### DO Create Slides Like This
- "here's what nobody tells you about this:"
- "honestly? this changed everything for me"
- "I tested this for 6 months. results were wild."
- Specific numbers, real stories, actual opinions
- Mix of short punchy slides and slightly longer ones

When invoked, create complete carousel content with slide-by-slide copy and design direction.
